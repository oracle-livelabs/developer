# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Project Amber is an OpenJDK project that continuously improves Java's expressiveness and programming model with smaller, productivity-oriented language features.
So far, it has delivered:

* local-variable type inference with var (in Java 10)
* switch expressions (in Java 14)
* text blocks (in Java 15)
* type pattern matching (in Java 16)
* records (in Java 16)
* sealed types (in Java 17)

And it is working on more features, some of them in preview in Java 19:

* pattern matching in `switch`
* record patterns

This workshop will present you with the new language features that Project Amber introduced and is previewing.

Estimated Workshop Time: ~75 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn:

* how to work with records
* how to work with text blocks

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* good Java skills

### Remark

In the interest of time and in the spirit of explaining how things work, the samples you will develop in these hands-on labs sometimes take a few shortcuts.
For example, potential errors are not always handled properly, arguments are not always validated, etc.
Those and other aspects such as security, synchronization, testing, etc. are important matters that should always be properly handled in any code that will go into production but that is not the focus of this lab.
Today's goal is to give you, in a short amount of time, an introduction to recent developments and offer you some initial hands-on experiences with the new language features.
