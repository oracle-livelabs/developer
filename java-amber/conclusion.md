#  Conclusion

## Project Amber Hands-On Lab

The goal of Project Amber is to explore and incubate smaller, productivity-oriented Java language features.
As such, it has already delivered a number of features and is currently working on finalizing pattern matching and creating more patterns.
More features like string interpolation and reduced ceremony for launching simple Java programs are on the horizon.

As such, we can't do it justice in the 60 to 90 minutes we have in this live lab.
We've focused on two specific features and dove deep so you could master them: text blocks and records.
The former were pretty straightforward with some interesting details around white space - of the indentation and of the trailing kind.
Text blocks are very standalone and will quickly find their way into your programming habits whenever you need them.

Records are a bit more subtle.
Their boilerplate reduction makes adoption very inviting but over time you will learn by experience where records fit in and where they don't so much.
An interesting aspect that we could not explore were record patterns, which are currently in their first preview in Java 19.
They tie records into the larger topic of pattern matching and are a great topic for you to explore on your own (see links below).
