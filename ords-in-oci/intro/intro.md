# Expand Oracle REST Data Services into Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

## About this Workshop

Like a swiss army knife or that as-seen-on-tv multi-tool you got from your grandmother on your birthday, Oracle REST Data Services can work with more than just the Oracle Database. This Lab will walk you through using ORDS to expose the database to multiple other OCI services and product as well as secure REST endpoints for external consumption.

*Estimated Workshop Time:* 2 Hours

### Objectives

In this lab you will create a series of scenarios in OCI where Oracle REST Data Services facilitates loading different types of data into an autonomous database securely. The situations will be:

- Consume a CSV file from Object Store with a REST enabled table in an Autonomous Database using Functions and Events
- Send Log Data to an Autonomous Database using OCI Logging and the Service Connector Hub and Functions

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
* Completed the [Getting Started](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/labs/cloud-login/pre-register-free-tier-account.md) lab

### About Oracle REST Data Services

Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) bridges HTTPS and your Oracle Database. A mid-tier Java application, ORDS provides a Database Management REST API, a web based SQL, JSON and REST workshops, a PL/SQL Gateway, SODA for REST, and the ability to publish RESTful Web Services for interacting with the data and stored procedures in your Oracle Database.

The Java EE implementation offers increased functionality including a command line based configuration, enhanced security, file caching, and RESTful web services. Oracle REST Data Services also provides increased flexibility by supporting deployments using Oracle WebLogic Server, Apache Tomcat, and a standalone mode. Oracle REST Data Services further simplifies the deployment process because there is no Oracle home required, as connectivity is provided using an embedded JDBC driver.

### About Functions

Oracle Functions is a fully managed, multi-tenant, highly scalable, on-demand, Functions-as-a-Service platform. It is built on enterprise-grade Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and powered by the Fn Project open source engine. Use Oracle Functions (sometimes abbreviated to just Functions) when you want to focus on writing code to meet business needs.

The serverless and elastic architecture of Oracle Functions means there's no infrastructure administration or software administration for you to perform. You don't provision or maintain compute instances, and operating system software patches and upgrades are applied automatically. Oracle Functions simply ensures your app is highly-available, scalable, secure, and monitored. With Oracle Functions, you can write code in Java, Python, Node, Go, and Ruby (and for advanced use cases, bring your own Dockerfile, and Graal VM). You can then deploy your code, call it directly or trigger it in response to events, and get billed only for the resources consumed during the execution.

More about Functions can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Functions/Concepts/functionsoverview.htm).

### About Service Connector Hub

Service Connector Hub is a cloud message bus platform that offers a single pane of glass for describing, executing, and monitoring movement of data between services in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Data is moved using service connectors. A service connector specifies the source service that contains the data to be moved, optional tasks, and the target service for delivery of data when tasks are complete. An optional task might be a function task to process data from the source or a log filter task to filter log data from the source.

More about the Service Connector Hub can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/service-connector-hub/overview.htm).

### About Logging

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging service is a highly scalable and fully managed single pane of glass for all the logs in your tenancy. Logging provides access to logs from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. These logs include critical diagnostic information that describes how resources are performing and being accessed.
