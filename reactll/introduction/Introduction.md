# Introduction
You have been tasked with developing a quick tool to optimize a Formula 1 team's race strategy. Determining which lap is chosen for the initial pit stop is a critical race-day decision. The React user interface will allow for quick processing of the data in a visually engaging manner. This quick processing will allow you to run multiple scenarios to determine the optimal pit stop lap based on the existing conditions.   

This is a great opportunity for you to learn about data management and exploratory analysis. You'll use these skills to discover the answer to our main question. **No experience required**, you will learn everything you need to know along the way!

*Estimated Lab Time*: 90 minutes

## About React Applications 
React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. 

**Technology Overview**
To complete this workshop you will use two Oracle technologies. You will utilize the Oracle Autonomous Database with DataLoad, and you will use Rest calls to connect the database to the React user interface application.

### Objectives

In this workshop you will:
* Provision an autonomous database.
* Use DataLoad to connect a prepared dataset and complete exploratory data analysis. 
* Connect the data to the React Application user interface.
* Make predictions to optimize Formula 1 race strategy. 

### Prerequisites
* An Oracle account. 

You are now ready to **start the first lab**.
