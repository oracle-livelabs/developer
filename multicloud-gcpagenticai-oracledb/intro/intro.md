# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop will help you build and understand a comprehensive, multi-cloud agentic AI solution using Google Vertex AI (Gemini) and Oracle AI Database.

You will develop intelligent AI agents that leverage the power of Google's Gemini models combined with Oracle's AI-powered database capabilities including vector search, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Select AI, and agentic memory. This integration demonstrates how to create sophisticated multi-agent systems that can reason, learn, and interact with enterprise data.

In this hands-on workshop, you'll deploy Oracle AI Database on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and build AI agents using Vertex AI Agent Builder and the Agent Development Kit (ADK). You'll explore how to implement vector embeddings for semantic search, create RAG pipelines for grounded AI responses, and build digital twin agents that can simulate and interact with real-world scenarios.

The workshop showcases the seamless integration between Google's cutting-edge AI models (Gemini) and Oracle's AI Database features, enabling you to:
- Store and query vector embeddings at scale
- Implement intelligent semantic search using Oracle AI Vector Search
- Build RAG applications that ground AI responses in your enterprise data
- Use Select AI to query databases using natural language
- Implement agentic memory for stateful, context-aware AI interactions
- Create multi-agent systems using Vertex AI Agent Builder

The following diagram illustrates this reference architecture.
