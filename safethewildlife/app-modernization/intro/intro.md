# Introduction

## The power of Cloud Native on Oracle Cloud

In this workshop, you will learn how to deploy a simple Three.js application to the cloud, then iterate through the modernization process to enhance the application and ultimately deploy it to Kubernetes.

When building and deploying applications in the cloud it is important to understand the capabilities provided by the cloud and learn to align those with the requirements of your application. Whether starting with enhancing a simple application, or deconstructing a legacy monolith, there are a variety of choices to help right-size your solution.

### Objectives
In this workshop, you will:

- Deploy a simple Three.js application to OCI Compute with Terraform, using Ansible to provide code and configuration.
- Create container images of the application components and migrate them to OCI Container Images.
- Add Redis and Nginx controller to your application to support scalability, while deploying to Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE).

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.
