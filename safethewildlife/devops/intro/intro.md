### Objectives

During this workshop, you will learn how to build, and deploy an application with several components using OCI DevOps. You will use Terraform to automate the infrastructure components in Oracle Cloud and OCI DevOps service to build and deploy the application into an OCI Kubernetes Cluster.

In this workshop, you will learn how to:
- Create a Kubernetes Cluster
- Create Autonomous Database
- Create a DevOps Project, a build pipeline and a deployment pipeline
- Move to the next version and practice a rollback

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the workshop.

### Prerequisites

You must have an OCI account. [Click here](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/?source=:ow:o:s:nav::DevoGetStarted&intcmp=:ow:o:s:nav::DevoGetStarted) to create a new cloud account.

You need an active GitHub Account to fork a repository.

This solution is designed to work with several OCI services, allowing you to quickly be up-and-running:
* [Container Engine for Kubernetes](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cloud-native/container-engine-kubernetes/)
* [OCI DevOps Service](https://www.oracle.com/devops/devops-service/)
* [Autonomous Database](https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/)
* [Oracle Coherence](https://www.oracle.com/java/coherence/)

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
