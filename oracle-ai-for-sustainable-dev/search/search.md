# Text Search and DBMS_SEARCH of AI results

## Introduction

This lab will show you how to use Oracle Database Text Search and DBMS_SEARCH to find records from the AI results obtained in the other labs in this workshop.
This allows for the optimal searching of AI text results and processing.

Estimated Time:  3 minutes


### Objectives

-   Use Oracle Database Text Search and DBMS_SEARCH

### Prerequisites

- Completion of Setup lab and "Run AI App" lab

## Task 1: Run the application

   1. Open http://localhost:8080 in a browser to access the application home page and click `Database Text Search and DBMS_SEARCH`.
   ![select search](images/search1.png " ")
   2. Enter a CONTAINS query clause/parameter in the text field such as the examples provided and click `Submit`.
   ![enter query](images/search2.png " ")
   3. Notice the results of the query of the AI results obtained in the other labs in this workshop.
   ![view results](images/search3.png " ")
   4. This should help you understand some syntax and power of Text Searches in the Oracle Database. Examine in the `sql/aiuser-tables-indexes-functions.sql` file how easy it was to create the index to enable this.
      
      ```
      CREATE TABLE aivision_results
          (id RAW (16) NOT NULL,
           date_loaded TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
           label varchar2(20),
           textfromai varchar2(32767),
           jsondata CLOB
           CONSTRAINT ensure_aivision_results_json CHECK (jsondata IS JSON));
      /
      
      create index aivisionresultsindex on aivision_results(textfromai) indextype is ctxsys.context;
      /
      ```

   DBMS\_SEARCH is new functionality in 23ai.  It is suggested that you try the [Easy Text Search over Multiple Tables and Views with DBMS_SEARCH in 23ai workshop](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=3721) to learn more.

You may now **proceed to the next lab.**..
