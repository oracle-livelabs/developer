# Introduction

## Build and Deploy your First Cloud Native App

Learn how to deploy applications into a cloud-native microservice-based development framework leveraging the Oracle Cloud Native solutions. You will deploy an eCommerce application with polyglot microservices for each component of a highly scalable architecture leveraging Kubernetes and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure components.

Estimated time: 2 hours

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create a Kubernetes Cluster on OKE
* Deploy an eCommerce microservices-based solution to Kubernetes (MuShop App) using [helm](https://helm.sh/)
* Explore your App
* Expose your app publicly
* Monitor your Kubernetes Cluster and the deployed App
* Create a Function Application
* Clean up the deployments

### Prerequisites

1. An Oracle Free Tier(Trial), Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account
1. [Familiarity with OCI console](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Concepts/console.htm)
