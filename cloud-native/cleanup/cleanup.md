    ````shell
    <copy>
    helm list --all-namespaces
    </copy>
    ````

    Sample response:

    ````shell
    NAME                    NAMESPACE               REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART                           APP VERSION

    oci-broker              mushop-utilities        1               2020-01-31 20:46:30.565257 -0600 CST    deployed        oci-service-broker-1.3.3
    mushop-utils            mushop-utilities        1               2020-01-31 20:32:05.864769 -0600 CST    deployed        mushop-setup-0.0.1              1.0
    ````

## Task 2: Clean Up MuShop App

1. Remove the application from Kubernetes where --name mushop was used during install.

    ````shell
    <copy>
    helm delete mushop --namespace mushop
    </copy>
    ````

## Task 3: Clean Up MuShop cluster dependencies

1. Remove the application from Kubernetes where --name mushop-utils was used during install.

    ````shell
    <copy>
    helm delete mushop-utils -n mushop-utilities
    </copy>
    ````

*Note:* When you execute the command `helm delete` for the mushop-utils chart release, the OCI LoadBalancer attached to the ingress kubernetes will also be terminated.

## Task 4: Terminate the OKE Cluster and Worker Nodes

1. Delete the OKE Cluster

![Delete Kubernetes Clusters](images/OKE-delete-cluster.png " ")

1. *Functions and Applications:* Navigate to **Developer Services -> Functions -> Applications** and delete the desired Application

1. *Containers:* Navigate to **Developer Services -> Container Registry** and delete the container image used on the functions lab
