# Full Stack Application for Medical Receipt Processing

## Introduction

This lab will show you how to use Oracle Database, Object Storage, and OCI Vision/Document AI to detect text in medical documents and store them accordingly (for example as an expense report).

Estimated Time: 5 minutes.

### Objectives

* Upload the image from the local file system to the OCI object storage bucket using OCI Object storage rest APIs
* Input this image to the AI Vision Document model and receive the JSON results.
* Receive the response JSON and parse it.
* Present the results in Flutter frontend.
* Understand the backend and frontend code.

### Prerequisites

- Completion of Setup lab


## Task 1: Create the table that will store the results of the processed documents.
   1. Open the SQL workshop tab for your database, copy and paste the contents of the `aiuser-aidocument_table.sql` file in the workshop source code `sql` and click the `Run Script` button.
      ![paste contents of aidocument table sql](images/createtableaidocuments.png " ")

## Task 2: Run the application

   1. Open the frontend via your preferred method as was done in setup and select the `Medical Documents` item from the sidebar menu.
      ![select medical documents button](images/medicaldocumentsbutton.png " ")


   2. Click the `Pick a File` button and Select a receipt image file. Example files are provided
      ![select receipt image file](images/selectfile.png " ")


   3. You will see the image file you selected. Now click `Submit`
      ![receipt image after select](images/selectedreceipt.png " ")


   4. Notice the results of the Oracle Document AI processing and parsed key/value fields.
      ![notice key value pairs from receipt doc](images/medicaldocs.png " ")


   5. Select the `Administration` item from the sidebar menu.
      ![select administration button](images/adminstrationbutton.png " ")


   6. Notice the results of the query for the documents that were stored in the database after AI processing.
      ![notice administration results](images/administrationresults.png " ")


## Task 3: Understand the code

   1. Notice the `/flutter-frontend/lib/medicaldocs.dart` source code and how it creates a request to the Spring Boot backend and parses the JSON response into resultant fields.


   2. Notice the `/springboot-backend/src/main/java/oracleai/MedicalDocsController.java` and related source code and how it creates a request to the document model deployed in the OCI Vision service and passes the JSON response back to the frontend.

You may now **proceed to the next lab.**..
