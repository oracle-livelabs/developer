# Setup Oracle Digital Assistant

## About this workshop

In this lab, we'll provision the Oracle Digital Assistant [ODA] from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services.

**Oracle Digital Assistant**

Oracle Digital Assistant delivers a complete AI platform to create conversational experiences for business applications through text, chat, and voice interfaces.

*Conversational AI*

Natural language understanding and machine learning
Oracle Digital Assistant applies deep semantic parsing using natural language processing, natural language understanding (NLU), and custom algorithms to understand common conversations to derive accurate intent and context.

*AI-powered voice*

Eliminate reliance on third-party offerings with Oracleâ€™s AI-powered voice. Users can communicate with their business application using voice commands with an assistant that understands their business-specific vocabulary and enables naturally expressive interactions. Give your customers more control of their data by providing end-to-end security and compliance with privacy standards, such as PII and GDPR.

*Analytics and insights*

Gain customer insights through built-in analytics that identify conversational bottlenecks and usage patterns and make data-driven decisions that continually improve the user experience.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

To set up the Oracle Digital Assistant on the OCI tenancy, you will:

* Oracle Digital Assistant for natural language processing(NLP), natural language understanding (NLU) 
* Provision Oracle Digital Assistant from OCI services
* Create Oracle Digital Assistant Skill 
* Adding Knowledge document for Frequently asked questions (FAQs)
* Train the ODA Model
* Preview the Model and Skill
* Add Auto Complete Suggestion and Utterances.
* Create Web Channel for a Skill

### Prerequisites

* A user with access to provision & manage Core OCI services like Oracle Digital Assistant
 
## Task 1: Log into OCI

1. Login into OCI

    To setup environment, you need OCI administrator's privileges. If you've got these privileges, login into OCI at [cloud.oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/sign-in.html). the below image indicates SSO Login as an administrative user. If you have administrative privileges and complete access over a tenancy then you need not create any of the policies below steps.
