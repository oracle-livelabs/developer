### About Data Labeling

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Labeling is a service for building labeled datasets to more accurately train AI and machine learning models. With OCI Data Labeling, developers and data scientists assemble data, create and browse datasets, and apply labels to data records through user interfaces and public APIs. The labeled datasets can be exported for model development across Oracle's AI and data science services for a seamless model-building experience.

In case of images, we need to assign a label to an image, which describes and classifies that image. Or using same service, we can annotate parts of images and again tell the system what is that particular part of an image. For example, a wheel as a part of the car in the picture.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Generate dataset records using Data Labeling for Breast Cancer
* Bulk image labeling
* Verify Bulk Data labelled images

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* Completed previous labs of this workshop: **Setup environment** and **Create image library**.

## Task 1: Generate dataset records using Data Labeling for Breast Cancer

Basic data labeling tool is provided within OCI. With this data labeling tool, you can label one image at the time, which is useful if your image library is not too large. In case of larger libraries, manual image labeling can be very time consuming and error prone. That is why, you will use programmatic data labeling using utilities provided by Oracle. Required code and instructions will be provided in the second task.

But before you continue, you need to perform the first step, **Create Dataset** based on your object storage based image library.

1. Navigate to Data Labeling page. From the **Navigator** menu select **Analytics & AI** and then **Data Labeling**.

    ![Navigate to Data Labeling](images/data-label.png " ")

2. Go to datasets. Click on **Datasets** link under **Data Labeling** on the left side of the page.

    ![Open Datasets page](images/open-datasets-page.png " ")

3. Create a new dataset. This will open **Dataset list** page in selected compartment (make sure you are in correct compartment as you might need to change compartment to the one you have created for this workshop).   
  
    Select *Images* from **Dataset format** and *Single label* for **Annotation class**.
 
    ![Create a new dataset](images/create-bc-dataset.png " ") 

    Click **Next**
  
4. Click *Select from Object storage* and select *Object storage bucket location* where the Breast cancer images have been uploaded.
  
    ![Create a new dataset](images/create-bc-dataset-2.png " ")
  
5. Add labels

    ![Create a new dataset](images/create-bc-dataset-3.png " ")

    Enter two labels: **BREAST\-WITH\-CANCER**, **NORMAL\-BREAST** in **Labels set** field.

    Click **Next** and Review the details provided and click **Create**
 
    ![Create a new dataset](images/create-bc-dataset-4.png " ")
 
## Task 2: Bulk image labeling

1. We have 5000+ images to label. This is too much to label images manually, hence we will use a python program to label images programmatically.

2. Oracle provides code which can be adjusted and used in your specific case. You can find the *original code* on [Github](https://github.com/oracle-samples/oci-data-science-ai-samples/tree/master/data_labeling_examples).

    ![Data labeling on Github](./images/data-labeling-examples.png " ")

3. Alternatively you can also download this python code. [data-labeling-python-code.zip](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/b1_vZe_9llVqw_oTDq-SQyRrkDshcuABTHc6QuUDG984jfUi0mbk5x7pOZ7mPDPh/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/partner-solutions/oas-and-vision/lab2.zip) to your computer.

4. Extract the zip file, it creates a folder structure similar 

    ![extract structure](images/view-extraction.png =60%x*)
 
5. Update *config.py* file with required configuration parameters

    In order to run the data labeling program properly, you need to make some changes in */data-labeling/config.py* and */.oci/config* files.

    Let's update and configure */data-labeling/config.py* first.

    *config.py* is basically empty at the beginning which needs to be updated as per your OCIDs

    ```python
    <copy># for help, run:
    # python3 help.py

    # config file path
    config_file_path="< PATH TO OCI CONFIG FILE >"
    # config file profile
    config_profile="DEFAULT"
    # region identifier of DLS Dataset
    # for example: eu-frankfurt-1
    region_identifier="< YOUR REGION >"
    # compartment where DLS Dataset exists
    compartment_id = "ocid1.compartment.oc1.... <YOUR COMPARTMENT OCID> ..."
    # ocid of the DLS Dataset
    dataset_id = "ocid1.datalabelingdataset.oc1.<REGION>.... <YOUR DATASET OCID> ..."
    # an array where the elements are all of the labels that you will use to annotate records in your DLS Dataset with. Each element is a separate label.
    labels = ["BREAST-WITH-CANCER", "NORMAL-BREAST"]
    # the algorithm that will be used to assign labels to DLS Dataset records
    labeling_algorithm = "first_match"
    # use for first_match labeling algorithm
    first_match_regex_pattern = r'^([^/]*)/.*$'
    # maximum number of DLS Dataset records that can be retrieved from the list_records API operation for labeling
    # limit=1000 is the hard limit for list_records
    list_records_limit = 1000</copy>
    ``` 
    Review the main.py  

    ```python
    <copy>
    import dls_list_records
    import dls_create_annotation
    import sys
    from config import *
    import datetime
    import labeling_schemas.first_letter as first_letter
    import labeling_schemas.first_match as first_match

    def main():
        num_records = list_records_limit
        count_batches=1
        count_records_total=0
        while num_records == list_records_limit: # if num_records < list_records_limit, that would indicate the last loop i.e. batch
            names, ids, num_records = dls_list_records.main()
            count_records_in_batch=0
            for n in names:
                if labeling_algorithm == "first_match":
                    first_match.main(name=n, record_id=ids[count_records_in_batch])
                elif labeling_algorithm == "first_letter":
                    first_letter.main(name=n, record_id=ids[count_records_in_batch])
                count_records_in_batch+=1
                count_records_total+=1
                print("current time: " + str(datetime.datetime.now()))
                print("current batch #: " + str(count_batches))
                print("# records labeled in current batch: " + str(count_records_in_batch))
            count_batches+=1
        count_batches-=1
        print("-----")
        print("TOTALS:")
        print("current time: " + str(datetime.datetime.now()))
        print("# batches: " + str(count_batches))
        print("# records labeled: " + str(count_records_total))
        print()
    main()
    </copy>
    ``` 
   
6. You can finally start with bulk image labeling. Run *main.py*.

    ```text
    <copy>python3 main.py</copy>
    ```

    Program will run approx. 20 minutes.
  
## Task 3: Verify Bulk Data labeled images

1. Verify if all the files have been labeled by our python code.

    ![Data Labeling is completed](images/verify-bulklabel.png " ")

2. We can click on the image and update label if required or verify the label

    ![Data Labeling is completed](images/normal-label.png " ")
  
This concludes this lab. You can **proceed to the next lab**.
