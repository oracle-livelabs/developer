# Introduction

## About Java Management Service Advanced Features

Java Management Service (JMS) consists of a series of advanced features that enables customers deeper observation and management of Java SE Runtimes and applications, tracking Java servers and libraries, performing JDK Flight Recorder, cryptographic analysis, Java migration analysis and performance analysis on Java applications.

As a customer, you can:
  * View and identify Java Runtimes.
  * Install Java Runtimes and perform java post-installation actions.
  * Remove unwanted Java Runtimes.
  * Track Java servers and libraries.
  * Perform cryptographic analysis of Java applications.
  * Perform JDK Flight Recording on Java applications.
  * Perform Java migration analysis on Java applications
  * Perform performance analysis on Java applications
  * View and understand various statuses and logs of work requests.

## About this Workshop

Java Management Service (JMS) is a reporting and management infrastructure integrated with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Platform services to observe and manage your use of Java SE (on-premises or in the Cloud). Java Runtimes can be viewed and identified in fleet after successful JMS setup on Managed Instances. 

Additionally, JMS offers 6 different advanced features to manage:
  * Lifecycle management (LCM) - Manage the lifecycle of Java runtimes in your fleet by installing or removing reported Java runtimes.
  * Advanced usage tracking - Gain advanced insights into your Java workloads in the fleet by tracking application server, Oracle JDK and OpenJDK used by applications. 
  * Crypto event analysis - Assess the impact of Oracle JRE and JDK Cryptographic roadmap on applications running in your fleet.
  * JDK Flight Recorder (JFR) - Collect information about events in the application running in your fleet using JDK Flight Recorder (JFR), a tool for collecting diagnostic and profiling data about a running Java application.
  * Java migration analysis - Evaluate the effort and feasibility of migrating Java applications to newer JDK versions
  * Performance analysis - Optimize Java workload performance with JVM tuning recommendations

Usage of these JMS advanced features requires only minor changes to the configuration. This workshop will walk you through the steps to enable JMS advanced features in OCI and non-OCI Managed Instances, configure post Java installation actions, install/remove Java Runtime, view/monitor work request, track Java servers, detect Java libraries, run crypto event analysis, run JDK Flight Recorder, run Java migration analysis as well as run performance analysis. 

_Estimated Time:_ 260 minutes
