### About Product/Technology

Learn how to use an Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle Container Registry (OCR) service, the Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) service and GraalVM and deploy a simple todo-list application using Next.js, an open-source React framework, and Helidon SE, an open-source cloud-native ready microframework for writing Java microservices.

### Objectives

In this 3 parts workshop, you will:

* Provision all resources including: a Kubernetes cluster, a working network in the cloud, an Oracle Autonomous Database instance and container registries
* Understand, build, and deploy a Java tier implementing the REST APIs, using the Helidon SE framework, Docker, the OCI Container Registry, and a Kubernetes service
* Understand, build, and deploy a ReactJS frontend/UI making REST calls to the Helidon service implementing the REST APIs using the Next.js framework
* Understand and deploy an ingress controller on your Kubernetes cluster to make the application accessible through a Load Balancer on OCI

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Free Tier or Paid Cloud Account
* Please refer to "Get Started"

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
