# Setup the development environment

## Introduction

In this tutorial, configure your development environment and collect information that will be used later throughout this workshop.

Estimated time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

* Launch the Cloud Shell
* Download the workshop code and scripts from GitHub
* Set up an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Compartment and install a two nodes Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) cluster
* Create an Oracle Autonomous Transaction Procesing (ATP)database, the user schema, and a database table
* Install GraalVM
* Create an OCI Registry and an authentication key
* Access OKE from the Cloud Shell

### Prerequisites

* This tutorial requires an [Oracle Cloud account](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/). You may use your own cloud account, a cloud account that you obtained through a trial, a Free Tier account, or a LiveLabs account.

## Task 1: Launch the Cloud Shell and Clone mtdrworkshop GitHub repository

1. Launch the Oracle Cloud Shell
The Oracle Cloud Shell is a small virtual machine running a Bash shell that you access through the Oracle Cloud Console. It comes with a pre-authenticate Command Line Interface (CLI) pre-installed and configured so you can immediately start working in your tenancy without spending time on its installation and configuration!
2. Click the Cloud Shell icon in the top-right corner of the Console.
	![Cloud Shell](images/7-open-cloud-shell.png " ")
3. Clone the GitHub repo and move up the `mtdrworkshop` directory.

	``` bash
	<copy>
	git clone --single-branch --branch helidon https://github.com/oracle/oci-react-samples.git
	</copy>
	```

	``` bash
	<copy>
	cd ~/oci-react-samples; mv mtdrworkshop ..
	</copy>
	```

	![clone](images/clone.png " ")

You should now see `mtdrworkshop` in your root directory

4. Change to `mtdrworkshop` directory.

	``` bash
	<copy>
	cd ~/mtdrworkshop
	</copy>
	```

5. Set the execution mode for all Shell scripts.

	``` bash
	<copy>chmod +x *.sh */*.sh</copy>
	```

**Note:**

* The Cloud shell will disconnect after a certain period of inactiity.
* If you are disconnected or logged off and return to Cloud shell, make sure you are back in the \~/mtdrworkshop directory.

## Task 2: Select Your Compartment and Create an OKE cluster in that compartment

Your own Oracle Cloud Infrastructure compartment for running this workshop has been assigned to you. The name of the compartment appears on the Launch page.

1. Copy the compartment name (not OCID) from the workshop reservation page.

![](images/copy-comp-name.png " ")

2. Select the navigation menu from the top left corner of the Oracle Cloud Console and navigate to the Instances page in the Compute section.

![](images/select-compute-instances.png " ")

3. Search for compartment using the compartment name from step#1 in the "Compartment" field under "List Scope".

![](images/enter-comp-name.png " ")

4. Select your compartment name from the drop down list.

![](images/select-comp-name.png " ")

![](images/correct-comp-name.png " ")

5. Go back into your cloud shell and verify you are in the `~/mtdrworkshop` directory.
6. Run `./setCompartmentId.sh <COMPARTMENT_OCID> <REGION_ID>` where your `<COMPARTMENT_OCID>` and `<REGION_ID>` values are set as arguments.
**For example**:
`./setCompartmentId.sh ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaaxbvaatfz6yourcomparmentidhere5dnzgcbivfwvsho77myfnqq us-ashburn-1`.
	![compartment id](images/compartmentid.png " ")
6. To create an OKE cluster, return to the OCI console and open up the navigation menu in the top-left corner of the Console and go to **Developer Services** and select **Kubernetes Clusters (OKE)**.
	![OKE Service](images/27-dev-services-oke.png " ")
7. Make sure you are in the newly created compartment and click **Create Cluster**.
(Please use the default schema in the unlikely situation that the newly created compartment is not quickly visible on the left menu.)
	![Create OKE](images/28-create-oke.png " ")
8. Click **Quick Create**; it will create the new cluster along with the new network resources such as virtual cloud network, internet gateway, NAT Gateway (NAT), regional subnet for worker nodes, and a regional subnet for load balancers. Click **Launch Workflow**.
	![OKE Wizard](images/29-create-oke-wizard.png " ")
9. Change the name of the cluster to `mtdrworkshopcluster`, accept all the other defaults, and click **Next** to review the cluster settings.
	![mtdrworkshopcluster](images/mtdrworkshopcluster.png " ")
	![create OKE wizard](images/31-create-oke-wizard3.png " ")
10. Close the window once you can.
	![close cluster](images/32-close-cluster-create.png " ")
11. Once launched, it usually takes 5 to 10 minutes for the cluster to be fully provisioned and the **Cluster Status** should show as **Active**.
	![click cluster name](images/33-click-cluster-name.png " ")
	![copy cluster](images/34-copy-cluster-id.png " ")
	\* There is no need to wait for the cluster to be fully provisioned at this point as we will verify cluster creation and create a kubeconfig to access it in a later step.

## Task 3: Create the Autonomous Transaction Processing database, the TODOUSER and the TODOITEM table

1. Open up the navigation menu in the top-left corner of the Oracle Cloud Console and select **Oracle Database** then click **Autonomous Transaction Processing**
	![oracle database](images/oracle-database.png " ")
2. Click **Create Autonomous Database**
	![ATP-config-1](images/ATP-config-1.png " ")
    * Set the **Compartment, Display Name** and **Database Name**.
	* Set `mtdrdb` as the database name  and display name (that name is being used in future commands)
	* Set the workload type to **Transaction Processing**.
    * Accept the default Deployment Type **Shared Infrastructure**.
3. Set the **ADMIN password, Network Access Type** and **License Type**
	![ADB setup](images/ADB-setup.png " ")
    * Set the database ADMIN password (12 to 30 characters, at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number) and confirm.
    Please write down the ADMIN password; it will be required later.
	
    * Set the **Access type** to **Secure access from everywhere**.
	![network access](images/network-access.png " ")

    * Set the license type to **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)** (does not matter for this workshop).
    * Click **Create Autonomous Database**.

> **Note:** The database creation will take a few minutes.

4. Copy the **database OCID**  and replace $DBOCID with it in the following command to populate mtdrworkshopdbid.txt.

	![copy DBOCID](images/copy-DBOCID.png " ")

	``` bash
	<copy>echo $DBOCID > ~/mtdrworkshop/workingdir/mtdrworkshopdbid.txt</copy>
	```

5. Generate the wallet for your Autonomous Transaction Processing connectivity. A wallet.zip file will be created in the current directory.

	\* Copy the following command and replace `$OCID` with the copied OCID.

	``` bash
	<copy>cd ~/mtdrworkshop/setup-dev-environment; ./generateWallet.sh $OCID</copy>
	```

	\* **Example** `./generateWallet.sh ocid1.autonomousdatabase.oc1.phx.abyhqlj....`
	\* You will be requested to enter a password for wallet encryption, this is separate password from the ADMIN password but you could reuse the same.
	\* Wait for a littke moment while the command executes.

6. Launch the sql utility in Cloud Shell.

	``` SQL
	<copy>sql /nolog</copy>
	```

	![SQLcl](images/SQLCl-Cloud-Shell.png " ")

	``` sql
	<copy>set cloudconfig wallet.zip</copy>
	```

	``` sql
	<copy>show tns</copy>
	```

	![show tns](images/Show-tns.png " ")
7. Connect to mtdrdb\_tp service as database ADMIN user (remember the password given to ADMIN above).

	``` sql
	<copy>connect ADMIN@mtdrdb_tp</copy>
	```

	![connect](images/connect.png " ")
	\* Point the tool at your wallet.zip file
	\* Stay in the mtdrwokshop/setup-dev-environment directory and launch sql with /nolog option.
8. Create a TODOUSER with a strong password (**in quotes**), using the sql utility.
	\* Suggest reusing the admin password, not a good practice in real life, but easy for this workshop
	``` sql
	<copy> CREATE USER todouser IDENTIFIED BY "password";</copy>
	```
	``` sql
	<copy> ALTER USER todouser DEFAULT TABLESPACE data TEMPORARY TABLESPACE TEMP;</copy>
	```
	``` sql
	<copy> GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO todouser WITH ADMIN OPTION;</copy>
	```

	\* After typing the `password` in the middle of the CREATE USER command, move the cursor to the end of the command, where the semicolon `;` is
	![create user](images/create-user.png " ")
	\* Grant some privileges to TODOUSER by executing the following command.

	``` sql
	<copy>grant create session, create view, create sequence, create procedure, create table, create trigger, create type, create materialized view to todouser;</copy>
	```

9. Connect as TODOUSER.

	``` sql
	<copy> connect todouser@mtdrdb_tp</copy>
	```

	![connect todouser](images/connect-todouser.png " ")
	\* Copy and paste the following command in the worksheet and execute it.

	``` sql	
	<copy>CREATE TABLE todoitem (id NUMBER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY, description VARCHAR2(4000), creation_ts TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, done NUMBER(1,0), PRIMARY KEY (id)); 	
	</copy>
	```
	![create-table](images/create-table.png " ")
10. Insert the first row, manually into TODOITEM table

	``` sql
	<copy>insert into todoitem  (description) values ('Manual item insert');</copy>
	```

	\* Then commit the inserted row

	``` SQL
	<copy>commit;</copy>
	```
<br>
	![commit complete](images/commit-complete.png " ")

		\* Execute "exit ;" after committing.

	``` SQL
	<copy>exit;</copy>
	```

## Task 4: Create an OCI Registry and a pre-authentication key

You are now going to create an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Registry and an Auth key. The OCI Registry is an Oracle-managed registry that enables you to simplify your development-to-production workflow by storing, sharing, and managing development artifacts such as Docker images.

1. Open up the navigation menu in the top-left corner of the console and go to **Developer Services** and select **Container Registry**.
	![Registry](images/21-dev-services-registry.png " ")
2. Take note of the namespace (for example, `axhpdrizd2ai` shown in the image below).
	![namespace](images/22-create-repo.png " ")
3. Click **Create Repository**, specify the following details for your new repository, and click **Create Repository**.
    * Repository Name: `<tenancy name>/mtdrworkshop`
    * Access: `Public`
    ![create repository](images/create-repository.png " ")
4. Go to Cloud Shell and run `./addOCIRInfo.sh` with the **namespace and repository name** as arguments.

	``` bash	
	<copy>cd ~/mtdrworkshop; ./addOCIRInfo.sh <namespace> <repository_name></copy>
	```

	\* For example `./addOCIRInfo.sh axhpdrizd2ai treehacks01/mtdrworkshop`
	![add info](images/add-info.png " ")
5. You will now create the authentication token by going back to the User Settings page. Click the Profile icon in the top-right corner of the Oracle Cloud Console and select **User Settings**.
	![user settings](images/23-user-settings.png " ")
6. Scroll down, click **Auth Tokens** and select **Generate Token**.
	![gen auth token](images/24-gen-auth-token.png " ")
7. In the **Description** field, type `mtdrworkshoptoken` and click **Generate Token**.
	![gen auth token](images/25-gen-auth-token2.png " ")
8. Copy the token value.
	![save auth token](images/26-save-auth-token.png " ")
9. Go to Cloud Shell, at the workshop root directory and run the
dockerLogin.sh scripts:
`./dockerLogin.sh <USERNAME> "<AUTH_TOKEN>"` where
    * The `<USERNAME>`: the user name used to log in (typically your email address). If your user name is federated from Oracle Identity Cloud Service, you need to add the `oracleidentitycloudservice/` prefix to your user name, for example, `oracleidentitycloudservice/firstname.lastname@something.com`
    * `"<AUTH_TOKEN>"`: paste the generated token value and enclose the value in quotes.
    **For example** `dockerLogin.sh user.foo@bar.com "8nO[BKNU5iwasdf2xeefU;yl"`
10. Once successfully logged into the Container Registry, we can list the existing docker images. Since this is the first time logging into Registry, no images will be shown.

	``` bash
	<copy>docker images </copy>
	```

## Task 5: Install GraalVM in Cloud Shell

We will be using the Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 in the Cloud Shell to build the Helidon image.

1. Set some environment variables and run the following commands

	``` bash
	<copy>export MTDRWORKSHOP_LOCATION=~/mtdrworkshop</copy>
	```

	``` bash
	<copy>export WORKINGDIR=$MTDRWORKSHOP_LOCATION/workingdir</copy>
	```

	\*  Execute the following script

	``` bash
	<copy>cd ~/mtdrworkshop/setup-dev-environment; ./installGraalVM.sh</copy>
	```

## Task 6: Access OKE from the Cloud Shell

1. Copy the **Cluster ID** from the Cloud console then replace `$ClusterID` with it in the following command and create the mtdrworkshop/workingdir/mtdrworkshopclusterid.txt file

	``` bash
	<copy>echo $ClusterID > ~/mtdrworkshop/workingdir/mtdrworkshopclusterid.txt</copy>
	```

2. Run `./verifyOKEAndCreateKubeConfig.sh`

	```
	<copy>cd ~/mtdrworkshop; ./verifyOKEAndCreateKubeConfig.sh</copy>
	```

> **Note:** `/.kube/config` is created for the OKE cluster.
> 	![verify OKE](images/verifyOKEOutput.png " ")

## Task 7: Configuring Network Security Rules

1. The network security rules control the inbound (Ingres) and the outbound (Egress) traffic. As we will be configuring the API Gateway in Part II, we will not set tight security rules at the Kubernetes cluster level.
2. Navigate to **Developer Services** then select **Kubernetes Clusters (OKE)**
	![dev services oke](images/27-dev-services-oke.png " ")
    * Click **mtdrworkshopcluster**
3. Click the VCN named starting with **oke-svclbsubnet-quick-mtdrworkshpcluster**.
	![OKE svclbsubnet](images/oke-svclbsubnet.png " ")
4. Click the existing security list.
	![add security](images/Add-security-lists.png " ")
5. Add an **ingress rule**.
Set the destination CIDR as indicated (leave other fields as-is) and then Click **Add Ingress Rules**
	![ingress rule](images/Ingress-rule.png " ")
6. Add an **egress rule**.
Set stateless and destination CIDR as indicated in the image (leave other fields as-is) and then Click **Add Egress Rules**
	![egress rule](images/Egress-rule.png " ")

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
