# CI/CD Pipeline with Oracle Database and Python

## Workshop Overview

**Continuous Integration (CI)** refers to the practice of frequently merging new software using a single line of code we call master branch. **Continuous Delivery (CD)** refers to the release of packaged software, modules, or features in frequent cycles. Likewise, **Continuous Deployment (CD)** refers to the deployment these software packages/modules/features to a production platform in frequent cycles.

>**Note** : Even though there are two CDs in the title (CI/CD/CD), only one is used in the acronym (CI/CD).

At a very high level, a CI/CD pipeline usually consists of the following five main steps:

1. **Commit** — When a developer finishes the work on a small change to an application, the code is committed and merged to a central source code repository.
2. **Build** — The change is checked out and verified to make sure the software can be run by a computer. This steps includes all dependencies, based on what programming language, set of libraries, and platform are used.
3. **Automated tests** — The change is tested from multiple angles using unit tests written by developers and testing tools, to ensure the change works and that it doesn't break anything else.
4. **Deliver** — Release new changes, automatically prepared for a production deployment, and make them available to end users on software repository.
5. **Deploy** — The built version is deployed to pre-production, or even production environment.

The entire workflow, and all pipelines are fully automated. This automation auto-magically converts a single commit by a developer into an update to production a few hours later.
