# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Welcome to the **Become a Data Engineer—Build an Oracle Database 23ai Test Lab** workshop!

In this workshop you learn to build your own Oracle Database 23ai free environment using Docker/Podman container on your own laptop.

**As a Data Engineer,** you play a critical role in developing, implementing, and maintaining systems and processes that transform raw data into high-quality, consistent information to support key use cases like analytics and machine learning. Your work sits at the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering, requiring a deep understanding of diverse tools and methodologies. Managing the data engineering lifecycle—from extracting data from source systems to delivering it for analysis or machine learning—is at the core of your responsibilities.

### What makes this workshop essential for becoming a Data Engineer?
Having access to a local database environment is crucial for you as a data engineer. 
- **Secure Development**: Provides a controlled environment to develop, test, and refine data pipelines without impacting live systems.
- **Experimentation**: Enables testing of new tools and approaches in a risk-free setting.
- **Troubleshooting**: Facilitates debugging and resolving complex workflows effectively.
- **Performance Optimization**: Allows fine-tuning and optimizing system performance in a simulated environment.
- **Reliability Assurance**: Ensures data quality and system dependability before production deployment.
- **Robust Solutions**: Empowers you to build efficient, reliable solutions tailored to analytics and machine learning demands.

### The role of the Database
**A database system is a crucial tool for a Data Engineer**. Data engineering primarily revolves around SQL, with relational databases serving as the main storage for data. Data processing tasks are typically performed using SQL or languages derived from it. In some cases, ETL tools are utilized for these processing activities.
As a Data Engineer, having immediate access to an Oracle Database to test and analyze data is an important step of the data engineering lifecycle.

Estimated duration: **90 minutes**

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

**Learn how to install and configure Oracle Database 23ai in a containerized environment.**
Aligns with the need for a secure, controlled environment to develop and test workflows without disrupting production systems. Containerized environments mirror real-world setups, allowing for efficient and risk-free experimentation.

**Set up a development environment with Visual Studio Code and the Oracle SQL Developer Extension.**
Reflects the importance of having an optimized development environment for data engineers. Integrated tools like VS Code and Oracle SQL Developer streamline tasks such as managing data pipelines and debugging, improving productivity and efficiency.

**Gain hands-on experience with containerized environments and their integration with IDEs.**
Supports the idea of experimenting with new tools and 23ai free using in an environment that can *easily be destroyed and recreated*. This practical experience enhances your ability to troubleshoot, optimize, and ensure the reliability of data workflows in a modern development landscape.

### Prerequisites

This workshop is designed to run entirely on your own computer, regardless of the operating system (macOS, Microsoft Windows, or Linux).
To ensure a seamless experience, please make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

**Software Permissions**
- Permission to install Podman Desktop or Docker Desktop on your laptop.
- Permission to install Visual Studio Code and its required extensions.

**Recommended Hardware Requirements**
To efficiently run the development environment, your laptop should meet or exceed the following specifications:

- **Processor:** Dual-core 2 GHz or higher (quad-core recommended). Supports x86-64 (Intel/AMD) or AArch64 (e.g., Apple Silicon).
- **RAM:** Minimum 8 GB (16 GB recommended).
- **Storage:** At least 20 GB of free space for containers, database files, and development tools.
- **Operating System:** Windows 10/11, macOS 11 or later, or a recent Linux distribution.
- **Internet Connection:** Required to download tools, images, and extensions during setup.

> **Note:** You can also set up the environment on a virtual private server. While this workshop does not provide step-by-step instructions for configuring a 23ai free container environment in the cloud, the "Get Started" lab includes instructions for setting up an OCI Free Tier trial account. During the trial, you can provision compute instances to install a 23ai free development environment.


If you have already Podman/Docker and Visual Studio Code installed, feel free to jump to Lab 3 to install Oracle' SQL Developer extension for VS Code.
