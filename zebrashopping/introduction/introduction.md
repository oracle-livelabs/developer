# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Looking to bring smarter, AI-driven experiences to your applications? In this workshop, you will see firsthand how Oracle AI Database can transform a simple shopping portal into a powerful discovery engine using similarity search. You will work with a real demo app—Zebra Sporting Goods—built with Python and the Flask framework, and explore how to create, store, and query vector data directly inside the database. By the end, you will not only understand how it works, but you will have seen it in action and explored the code yourself. Whether you are a developer, data engineer, or product innovator, this workshop will give you practical insights into building secure, modern AI-powered applications—without having your data leave the database.

Estimated Workshop Time: 60 minutes
