# Introduction

## About Java Management Service and Oracle Analytics

Java Management Service (JMS) is a reporting and management infrastructure integrated with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Platform services to observe and manage your use of Java SE (on-premise or in the Cloud).

Oracle Analytics Cloud is a scalable and secure Oracle Cloud service that provides a full set of capabilities to explore and perform collaborative analytics for you, your workgroup, and your enterprise.

As a customer, you can:

* Create interactive workbooks in Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) by integrating Java Management Service (JMS) data exports to visualize and track Java SE usage across multiple OCI regions and hybrid environments, including managed instances, Java runtimes, applications, IP addresses, and host names in a centralized view.

## About this Workshop

This workshop is a follow up workshop to the [Manage Java Runtimes, Applications and Managed Instances Inventory with Java Management Service](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=912) workshop, which we recommend to be completed before beginning this workshop about Integrating Oracle Analytics Cloud with Java Management Service.

This workshop guides you through connecting JMS to Oracle Analytics Cloud, exporting Java inventory and usage data, and building real-time dashboards with data from multiple regions.

*Estimated Workshop Time:* 90 minutes

### Objectives

* Understand core concepts of JMS integration with OAC for Java SE monitoring and analytics.
* Export JMS inventory data to Autonomous AI Database for centralized storage.
* Provision and connect an OAC instance to Autonomous AI Database for secure data access.
* Build interactive workbooks and real-time dashboards in OAC using prebuilt templates.
* Automate periodic data refreshes to maintain up-to-date visualizations of Java usage across regions and hybrid environments.

### Prerequisites

* This workshop requires an Oracle Cloud account. You may use your **own cloud account** or you can get a **Free Trial** account as described in [Get Started](?lab=cloud-login).
* Have access to the cloud environment with the resources configured by following the steps in the workshop [Manage Java Runtimes, Applications and Managed Instances Inventory with Java Management Service](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=912).
