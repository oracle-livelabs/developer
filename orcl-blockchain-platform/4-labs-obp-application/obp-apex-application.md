3. Click the 'Substitutions' tab as shown.

  ![Substitions](images/lab-4-task4-step3.png)

4. Replace all the **Substitutions** copying the URL from *Lab 3* and 'Apply Changes':
    - Set OBP\_MAIN\_INSTANCE\_URL to the URL you found in the **Deployment Information**  section in the previous lab (Lab 3: Created & Setup API Gateway to connect with Smart Contract API's). This allows APEX to connect to the Car Marketplace OBP REST API endpoints via the API Gateway deployment. Change OBP\_MAIN\_INSTANCE\_URL, OBP\_DEALER\_1\_URL, OBP\_DEALER\_2\_URL based on the routes configured in *Lab 3*  

    ![Substitions Form](images/4-apex-4-4-1.png)
    ![Substitions Form](images/4-apex-4-4-2.png)

    - Set DEALER\_1\_URL and DEALER\_2\_URL to john\_dealer1 and sam\_dealer2, respectively. This gives information on API routing.
    - Set MARKETPLACE to marketplace.

    ![Substitions Form](images/lab-4-task4-step3.png)

5. Go back and  Select 'App Builder' as shown.

  ![Access App Builder](images/4-apex-3-4.png)

6. Click on Car Marketplace Application --> Navigate to 'Workspace Utilities'

  ![Access App Builder](images/4-apex-4-1.1.png)

7. Click on to 'Remote Servers'

  ![Access App Builder](images/4-apex-4-1.2.png)

8. Create new remote server cofiguration based on the Gateway configuration in *Lab 3*

  Build Remote server configuration based on *Lab3 Task4*:
    - Set **Name** to the 'Hostname' found in the Gateway details, accessible from the OCI service console.

  ![Gateway Hostname](images/4-apex-4-9-1.png)
    - Give your server a  **Static Identifier** (e.g. by changing all punctuation in **Name** to underscores as shown).
    - Set **Endpoint URL** to the same https://'Hostname' from the Gateway details.
    - Now, create remote server in Apex and apply changes

  ![Access App Builder](images/4-apex-4-1.3.png)

9. Next, scroll towards the bottom of your 'App Builder' ---> 'Car Marketplace Application'

  ![Access App Builder](images/4-apex-4-1.3.1.png)

10. Click on 'Shared Components' -->  Select 'REST Data Sources.'

  ![REST Data Sources](images/4-apex-4-6-1.png)

  ![REST Data Sources](images/4-apex-4-6-2.png)
  
  ![REST Data Sources](images/4-apex-4-6.png)
  
10. Now, we can see the following REST Sources configured with remote server URL configured:
    - 'GetAccountBalance'
    - 'GetInvoiceByRange'
    - 'GetCarsByRange'
    - 'GetCarHistoryById'
    - 'GetPOByRange'
    - 'GetInvoiceByRannge'
    - 'GetCarTitleToken1
    - 'GetCarTitleToken2'
    - 'GetCarServicesDealer1'
    - 'GetCarServicesDealer2'
    - 'GetCarTitleToken1
    - 'GetCarTitleToken2'
    - 'GetCarServicesDealer1'
    - 'GetCarServicesDealer2'

  ![Repeat APEX Data Source Steps](images/lab-4-task4-step10.png)

You may now proceed to the next lab.

5. Proceed to payment by clicking a car in the Marketplace. This car will disappear from the Marketplace when sold.

5. When a transaction begins, it will show up in the 'Orders' tab. Here, you will see that the car you created is currently pending sale.

6. Click on the pencil icon next to this pending order and click 'Process Order.' Here, the car will go back to the dealer who submitted the order. This dealer can **Filter data** by 'Orders Placed' to see that the transaction has processed. They can then 'Accept Receipt' to purchase or simply 'Withdraw Order.'

--describe tokenization-- tokens will be put on hold while transaction is processed and order is confirmed -->
