# Deploy, Test Smart Contracts using Blockchain App Builder & Oracle Blockchain Admin Console

## Introduction

Blockchain App Builder is a tool set that assists Oracle Blockchain Platform users with rapid development, testing, debugging, and deployment of chaincode on Oracle Blockchain Platform networks. Blockchain App Builder is accessible through Visual Studio Code as an extension and through a lightweight command line interface. Blockchain App Builder to manage the complete life cycle of a token. Developers can tokenize existing assets and automatically generate token classes and methods to use for token lifecycle management.

*Estimated Lab Time:* 25 minutes

### About OBP Tokenization

1. Tokenization is a process where physical or digital assets are represented by tokens, which can be transferred, tracked, and stored on a blockchain. By representing assets as tokens, you can use the blockchain ledger to establish the state and ownership of an asset and use standard blockchain platform functions to transfer ownership of an asset.

2. You can use the Blockchain App Builder Extension to manage the complete life cycle of a token. You can tokenize existing assets and automatically generate token classes and methods to use for token lifecycle management.

3. This lab incorporates tokenization, enabling our car marketplace administrator to initialize, mint, and transfer fungible, fractional tokens to and from `john_dealer1` and `sam_dealer2`.

4. The tokenization feature uses an account/balance model to represent tokenized assets as balances in accounts - `john_dealer1` and `sam_dealer2`. The balance of their accounts is tracked globally, to ensure that transaction amounts are valid when buying/selling cars. The on-hold balance and transaction history are also tracked.

## Task 4: User Enrollment - Perform on All nodes (marketplace, dealer1, dealer2)

  Oracle Blockchain Platform supports enrollments to the REST proxy. You use enrollments with token chaincodes to ensure the identities of the users completing token transactions. To do this, when you add enrollments for token use cases, specify a user ID for each enrollment (founder ID in this case), and specify one and only one user for each enrollment.

1. While logged into the marketplace founder instance, navigate to Nodes in OBP console.

2. Click on the hamburger menu besides restproxy and select 'View or manage enrollments.'
  ![View or Manage Enrollments](images/view_or_manage_enrollments.png)

3. Select Create New Enrollment.

  ![Create New Enrollment](images/create_new_enrollment.png)

4. Input enrollment information. See sample enrollment as example. Enrollment user had to be created in idcs. In this example 'marketplace','dealer1','dealer2' is used. Make sure the user has REST_Client role assoicated with the Blockchain instance.
    - For marketplace Instance --> Create enrollments for marketplace, dealer1 & dealer2

  ![Sample Enrollment](images/enrollment_marketplace.png)

    - For dealer1 Instance --> Create enrollemnt for dealer1

  ![Sample Enrollment](images/enrollment_dealer1.png)

    - For dealer2 Instance ---> Create enrollemnt for dealer2

  ![Sample Enrollment](images/enrollment_dealer2.png)

5. Click Enroll.


## Task 5: Initialization and Issuance of Car Marketplace FiatToken

1. Click on Postman on the VNC Desktop --> Import the Marketplace Tokenization Postman collection [Marketplace Tokenization](files/car_marketplace.postman_collection.json?download=1) and assign variable definitions as shown.

2. Enter the collection setup variables in Postman Environment. Some sample definitions are shown below.

  ![Tokenization Definitions](images/tokenization_definitions_1-1.png)

3. Open tokenization collection Marketplace_Tokenization, and run integrations as described in steps 0 â€“ 6 by clicking Send:

    - Step 0 - Init: Called when chaincode is instantiated. Token Admin is identified by `user_id` and `org_id`.

  ![Init](images/init_1.png)

    - Step 1 â€“ Initialize Token: This method creates a token and initializes the token properties. The asset and its properties are saved in the state database. This method can be invoked only by the Token Admin of the chaincode.


  ![Initialize Token](images/initialize_token_1.png)

    - Step 2 â€“ Create(Admin User):  This method creates an account for a specified user and token. An account must be created for any user who will have tokens at any point. Accounts track balances, on-hold balances, and transation history.

  ![Create Accounts](images/create_accounts_1.png)

    - Step 3 â€“ Associate Acoount: Copy the account id  received from Step2 when creating the account in step. Substitute the accountid while associating the account as shown.

  ![Initialize Token](images/associate_token.png)

    - Step 4 â€“ Add Role: This method adds a role to a specified user and token. This method can be called only by the Token Admin of the chaincode.

  ![Add Role](images/add_role_1.png)

    - Minter Role: mints a quantity of tokens, which are then owned by the caller of the method.

    - Step 5 â€“ Mint Fiat Token Tokens: This method mints batch of tokens, which are then owned by the caller of the method. The caller must have an account and the minter role.

  ![Issue Tokens](images/mint_fiat_token.png)

## Task 6: Initialization and Issuance of Car Title Registration NFT

1. Use the same postman collection imported in Task5 --> Step 1 & 2

2. Create Dealer1, Dealer2 Accounts --> Associate Fiat Tokens to dealer accounts --> Assign Minter Roles

    - Step 5, 5.1, 6, 6.1 â€“ Create Accounts & Associate Tokens to Car Title Registration NFT Accounts (Dealer1 Account, Dealer2 Account) for creating a Car Title NFT's to trade vehicles between dealer1 & dealer2:  These methods creates an account for a specified user and add role to trade a NFT's between dealer1 and dealer2. An account must be created for any user who will have fiat tokens at any point. Accounts are created to track Car tile NFT's for each vehicle created and traded.
    
  ![Create Accounts](images/6-app-builder-cartitle-createaccount-dealer1_1.png)
  ![Initialize Token](images/6-app-builder-cartitle-associateaccount-dealer1_1.png)
