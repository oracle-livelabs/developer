# Deploy, Test Smart Contracts using Blockchain App Builder & Oracle Blockchain Admin Console

## Introduction

Blockchain App Builder is a tool set that assists Oracle Blockchain Platform users with rapid development, testing, debugging, and deployment of chaincode on Oracle Blockchain Platform networks. Blockchain App Builder is accessible through Visual Studio Code as an extension and through a lightweight command line interface. Blockchain App Builder to manage the complete life cycle of a token. Developers can tokenize existing assets and automatically generate token classes and methods to use for token lifecycle management.

*Estimated Lab Time:* 25 minutes

### About OBP Tokenization

1. Tokenization is a process where physical or digital assets are represented by tokens, which can be transferred, tracked, and stored on a blockchain. By representing assets as tokens, you can use the blockchain ledger to establish the state and ownership of an asset and use standard blockchain platform functions to transfer ownership of an asset.

2. You can use the Blockchain App Builder Extension to manage the complete life cycle of a token. You can tokenize existing assets and automatically generate token classes and methods to use for token lifecycle management.

3. This lab incorporates tokenization, enabling our car marketplace administrator to initialize, mint, and transfer fungible, fractional tokens to and from `john_dealer1` and `sam_dealer2`.

4. The tokenization feature uses an account/balance model to represent tokenized assets as balances in accounts - `john_dealer1` and `sam_dealer2`. The balance of their accounts is tracked globally, to ensure that transaction amounts are valid when buying/selling cars. The on-hold balance and transaction history are also tracked.

5. Feel free to learn more about [Tokenization support with OBP](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/blockchain-cloud/usingoci/tokenization-support.html).

## Task 6: Create Fiat Tokenization Specifications

The flow for developing smart contracts for tokenization begins with creating a specification file that describes our fiat token. `Car_Tokenization.yml` describes our FiatToken structure: AssetType, `Token_id`, `Token_name`, `Token_desc`, `Token_type`, and behavior.  

The specification file is then used to scaffold a smart contract project ('`car_tokenization_cc`') and generate source code for models and controllers. Each object has properties that characterize the assets, data types and validations.

You can see sample specification files (and write your own specifications) in either YAML or JSON using the Blockchain App Builder package. [FiatToken Structure](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/blockchain-cloud/usingoci/input-specification-file-fungible-tokens.html)
