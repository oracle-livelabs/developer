# Connect to data

## Introduction

Now that we've created the UI for our App UI, it's time to connect the extension to data that lives in Oracle Cloud Applications.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### About this lab

Oracle Cloud Applications provides REST-based access to its data. In this lab, we'll use the service catalog in VB Studio to browse available REST services, pick one, then display data from it on the page. You'll also test the App UI to make sure it's working correctly.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create a service connection to access Oracle Cloud App data
* Display data in the App UI's page and set up filtering
* Test the App UI

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have all previous labs successfully completed.

## Task 1: Create a service connection

Create a connection to the Oracle Human Capital Management (HCM) services catalog to display employee data on the main-start page.

1. Click ![Services icon](images/icon-services.png) **Services** in the Navigator.

2. In the Services pane, click **+ Service Connection**.

    ![This image shows the Services selected in the Navigator. In the Service Connections tab, the + Service Connection button is selected.](images/services-create-service-connection.png)

3. In the **Select Source** screen of the Service Connection wizard, click **Select from Catalog**.

4. Click the **Human Capital Management** tile.

    ![This image shows the Create Service Connection wizard Service Catalog screen with the Human Capital Management tile selected.](images/hcm-tile.png)

5. In the **Create Service Connection** screen, enter `hcmRest` as the Service Name.

6. In the **Filter Objects/Endpoints** text box, enter `work`, then select **publicWorkers** from the search results.

    ![This image shows the Create Service Connection page with the word "work" entered in the search field and the publicWorkers object selected.](images/publicworkers.png)

7. Click **Create**.

    Now we can use this service connection to create the list of employees we want.

## Task 2: Display data and set up filtering

Display a list of employees based on data we get from HCM, then set up a mechanism to filter the list based on the employee's display name. We want to compare each name to whatever the user enters as a search string, in order to find the proper match.

1. Switch to the main-start page. Click the **main-start** tab just below the header, or click ![App UIs icon](images/icon-appuis.png) **App UIs** in the Navigator and select **main-start** under the **empsearch** and **main** nodes.

2. Select the **Data** tab in the Page Designer, then expand **Services** and **hcmRest**.

    ![This image shows the Data tab in the Page Designer with Services and hcmRest nodes expanded. The publicWorkers is being dragged and dropped on the canvas.](images/publicworkers-datatab.png)

3. Drag **publicWorkers** into Structure view and drop it on the **Welcome Page Template**, then select **Default** in the slots pop-up.

    ![This image shows the publicWorkers service being dropped onto the Welcome Page Template in the Structure view. The Select a Slot pop-up shows the Default slot as available, with the Search slot shown as full.](images/welcome-page-template-default-slot.png)

4. When shown options to display the data, select **Table** (not Table Dynamic, the first option).

    ![This image shows a "Render as" pop-up below the Welcome Page Template component. The second "Table" item is selected. Other options include Table Dynamic, List Dynamic, Details Dynamic, and List](images/render-as-list-selection.png)

5. In the Add Data wizard, the **Endpoint Structure** panel shows all the fields that are available for us to choose from in the **publicWorkers** object. Use the Filter and select the **DisplayName**, **PhoneNumber** and **LocationTownOrCity** fields to show as table columns. Click **Next**.

    ![This image shows the Add Data page with the word "LocationTownOrCity" in the Endpoint Structure search field. In the Columns Fields, DisplayName, PhoneNumber, and LocationTownOrCity are shown.](images/add-data-wizard-binddata.png)

6. In the **Define Query** screen, select **filterCriterion** in the **Target** panel.

    ![This image shows the Define Query page with { } filterCriterion highlighted in the Target pane.](images/add-data-wizard-definequery-filtercriterion.png)


7. At the bottom of the page, click **Click to add condition**.

8. Set up the condition as follows:

    * **Attribute**: DisplayName (Select the **DisplayName** attribute that's not part of the assignments list.)
    * **Operator**: contains ($co)
    * **Value**: $variables.searchString

    ![This image shows the filterCriterion builder at the bottom of the Define Query page. DisplayName is entered in the IF field, contains ($co) is chosen in the operator field, and $variables.searchString is in the variable field.](images/add-data-wizard-definequery.png)

9. Click **Done**, then **Finish**.

    The main-start page should filter and display a list of employees in a table:
    ![This image shows a list of employees displayed in a table under the Emp Name search  field.](images/empdisplay.png)

## Task 3: Test the App UI

Test your App UI to make sure it's working as expected.

1. Click ![Preview icon](images/icon-preview.png) **Preview** in the header.

2. When the App UI opens in a new browser tab displaying a list of employees, enter criteria, like the first name `David`, in the **Emp Name** field to filter the list and hit **Enter**:

    ![This image shows a preview of the App UI. The name "David" is entered in the search field and the results of the search are listed underneath.](images/preview.png)

3. Close the browser tab.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
