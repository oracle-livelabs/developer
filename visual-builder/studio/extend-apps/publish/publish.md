# Test and publish the extension

## Introduction

Now that we've set up the App UI in our extension, we'll test it to make sure it's working correctly. We'll then publish the extension and view the App UI deployed to your Oracle Cloud Applications instance.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Test your App UI's pages
* Deploy your App UI's extension to your Oracle Cloud Application instance
* Access the deployed extension

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have all previous labs successfully completed.

## Task 1: Test the App UI

You can preview your App UI to run it in its own browser tab and see how it will appear to a user.

1. Click ![Preview icon](images/icon-preview.png) **Preview** in the header.

2. When the App UI opens displaying a list of employees, enter criteria, like the first name `David`, in the **Emp Name** field to filter the list and hit **Enter**:

    ![This image shows a preview of the App UI. The name "David" is entered in the search field and the results of the search are listed underneath.](images/preview.png)

3. Close the browser tab.

## Task 2: Publish the extension

After you've confirmed search is working, you are ready to deploy the extension with its App UI to your Oracle Cloud Applications instance.

1. Click **Publish** in the header.

    ![This image show the Publish button selected in the upper right corner of the workspace.](images/publish.png)

2. In the Publish dialog, enter a description of the changes in the **Commit Message** field, then click **Publish**:

    ![This image shows the Publish Changes dialog with Merge Now selected and the "Search Application for HCM" entered in the Commit Message field.](images/publish-changes-dialog.png)

3. If prompted, provide your user name and password for your development instance. These **must** be Oracle Cloud Application credentials, as opposed to Visual Builder Studio or SSO credentials:

    ![This image shows the Missing Deployment Credentials dialog. The User Name field has john.dunbar entered in it and the Password field is empty.](images/deployment-creds.png)

4. When the changes are published to your project's Git repository, click **Close**.
    ![This image shows Publish CHanges dialog detailing the steps taken to deploy changes from your workspace to the project's repository in this order: Checking environments and build jobs, git commit branch1, git fetch, git merge main to branch1, git merge branch1 to main, and git push. There's also a message asking the user not to use the current branch as changes are being deployed and that a new branch maryjane-timestamp has been temporarily created for the user.](images/published.png)

    What you're seeing are the Git steps taken to push your changes from the local **branch1** to the remote **branch1**, then to merge them to the project's **main** branch.

## Task 3: View the deployed extension

Once your changes are successfully merged to your project's repo, VB Studio automatically kicks off the default build jobs that deploy the extension to your environment's Oracle Cloud Applications instance.

1. Click ![Go to project page icon](images/icon-gotoprojectpage.png) in the header to go to the Project Home page.

2. In the main navigation, click the ![Builds icon](images/icon-builds.png) **Builds** tab to check the packaging and deployments jobs. 

    If the build job is still running, you can view its progress in the **Job Queue** tab. It might take a few minutes for the build to start if an executor isn't immediately available.

    ![This image shows the Builds section Job Queue tab in VB Studio. A progress indicator shows status for the DemoHCMSearch-Package job.](images/job-queue.png)

3. When the status of both jobs is green, click the ![Environments icon](images/icon-environments.png) **Environments** tab, select **Deployments**, then **Application Extensions**.

4. Expand the **site_DemoHCMSearch** extension, then click ![Open icon](images/icon-openappui.png) next to the **hcmsearch** App UI to open it in a new browser tab:

    ![This image shows the Environments tab. The Development environment is selected and the Deployments tab is shown. In the Applications Extensions section, DemoHCMSearch is highlighted and expanded and hcmsearch is highlighted in the App UIs column.](images/deployment.png)

    You can now view the App UI deployed to your environment's Oracle Cloud Applications instance.

<!-- You may now **proceed to the next lab**. -->
