# Publish the extension

## Introduction

Now that we've tested the App UI in our extension, we're ready to publish the extension and view the App UI deployed to your Oracle Cloud Applications instance.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### About this lab

Publishing saves your application's code from the local branch in your workspace to the remote branch in the project's Git repository, then to the project's default branch (main). While it's possible to complete each of these Git operations separately, it's simplest to do all of this at the click of a single **Publish** buttonâ€”as we'll do in this lab.

Once your changes are successfully merged, VB Studio automatically deploys them to your environment's Oracle Cloud Applications instance. Note that your changes are deployed *directly* to your Oracle Cloud Applications instance by default. This is the simplest, most straightforward approach to quickly see your changes. If you want others to review your changes as part of a merge request or you'd like to automate some lifecycle operations, you'll want to use CI/CD pipelines. See [Use CI/CD Pipelines for Deployment](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/visual-builder/visualbuilder-administration/set-ci-cd-pipelines-deployment.html) for details. For simplicity, this workshop only showcases direct deployment.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Deploy your App UI's extension to your Oracle Cloud Application instance
* Access the deployed extension
* (Optional) Manage the deployed extension

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have all previous labs successfully completed.

## Task 1: Publish the extension

After you've confirmed search is working, you are ready to deploy the extension with its App UI to your Oracle Cloud Applications instance.

1. Click **Publish** in the header.

2. In the Publish dialog, enter a description of your changes in the **Commit Message** field.

    ![This image shows the Publish Changes dialog with "Employee Search Application" entered in the Commit Message field. The Target Branch is set to "main" and the New Working Branch Name is set to the default suggested name.](images/publish-changes-dialog.png)

    Note the **New Working Branch Name**. Once you publish a branch, you can no longer use it, so VB Studio automatically creates a new working branch and switches your workspace to it for any future changes. It's recommended that you provide a more meaningful name for your new working branch.

    Click **Publish**.

3. Once your changes are merged to the project's **main** branch and deployed to your instance, click the link in the Publish dialog to access your Oracle Cloud Applications instance.
    ![This image shows Publish Changes dialog detailing the steps taken to deploy changes from your workspace to the project's repository in this order: Checking environments and build jobs, git commit branch1, git fetch, git merge main to branch1, git merge branch1 to main, and git push. There's also a message asking the user not to use the current branch as changes are being deployed and that a new branch maryjane-timestamp has been temporarily created for the user.](images/published.png)

    **Note:** Make sure you copy and paste the deployment URL to your clipboard before you click **Close**. You won't have access to the URL after the Publish dialog is closed.

## Task 2: View your deployed extension

Access your environment's Oracle Cloud Applications instance to view your deployed extension.

1. When your Oracle Cloud Applications instance opens in a new browser tab, click the navigation menu ![Hamburger menu icon](images/icon-menu.png) in the upper left corner.

2. Scroll down to the bottom and expand **Others**, then select **empsearch** (the App UI name).

    ![This image shows the Others section in the navigation menu expanded, with the empsearch App UI highlighted.](images/deployment-others-empsearch.png)

    You can now view and experiment with the App UI on your Oracle Cloud Applications instance.

## Task 3: Manage your deployed extension

Once your extension is deployed, you can manage its lifecycle, say to deploy it to other environments or to delete it.

1. Switch to your VB Studio instance, click ![Menu icon](images/icon-designer-menu.png) in the Designer's upper right corner, and select **Extension Lifecycle**.

2. On the Manage Extension Lifecycle page, expand the **DEV** environment and click ![Extension Details icon](images/manageextensionlifecycle-details-icon.png) to view extension details and access your App UI.

    ![This image shows the Environments tab. The DEV environment is selected and the Deployments tab is shown. In the Applications Extensions section, DemoEmpSearch is highlighted and expanded and empsearch is highlighted in the App UIs column.](images/deployment.png)

3. Use other available options as needed:
    * Click ![Deploy to Environment icon](images/manageextensionlifecycle-deploy-icon.png) to deploy your extension to other environments (you will first need to add another environment with an Oracle Cloud Applications instance).
    * Click ![Delete Extension icon](images/manageextensionlifecycle-delete-icon.png) to delete the extension if it's no longer required.

    For details, see [Manage Your Published Extensions](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/visual-builder/visualbuilder-building-appui/manage-your-published-extensions.html).

    <!-- Now click ![Open icon](images/icon-openappui.png) next to **empsearch** to open your App UI in a new browser tab.

    ![This image shows the Extension Details pane with details such as extension name, ID, version, App UIs, Dependencies, and Version History. The empsearch App UI is highlighted.](images/deployment-appui.png) -->

Your work is now finished! Thank you for completing this workshop.
