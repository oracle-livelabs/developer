# Create a project for a new visual application

## Introduction

This lab shows you how to create a project for a new visual application, the foundation to build a web application in Oracle Visual Builder Studio.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### About this Lab

In this workshop, you'll build a simple Human Resources app using a _project_. Every project in VB Studio is devoted to a discrete software effort, and the project you create in this lab is exclusive to the HR app. The project brings together all the tools you need to create your app: a Git repository to store your source code, an environment to deploy your application, a pipeline to provide continuous integration and delivery, an issue tracking system, and more.

As part of your project, you'll also create a _workspace_, a completely private area for you to work on your application. The changes you make in your workspace are stored in a clone of the project's Git repository, and are not visible to others until you share or publish them.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create a project for a visual application
* Create an environment with a separate Visual Builder instance
* Create a workspace to work on your visual application

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* A Chrome browser
* A VB Studio instance and a separate Visual Builder instance

## Task 1: Create a project for a visual application

As someone who creates a project, you'll automatically become the project's owner, responsible for project management. For the purposes of this workshop, we'll assume that you're also the developer who will create the HR web application.

1. On VB Studio's Organization page, click **\+ Create** on the **Projects** tab.

    ![The All Projects page that appears when the Organization tab is selected on the main menu. The Projects tab is empty, with the Create button selected.](images/welcome.png "All projects screen")

2. On the Project Details step of the New Project wizard:

    * Enter **Tutorial HR Project** as the **Name**. You may want to add your name to the project name if you're in a large organization.
    * Enter **Tutorial project** as the **Description**.
    * Leave the **Security** settings as **Private** and **Discoverable** (the default).
    * Leave the **Preferred Language** as **English** (the default).

    Click **Next**.

3. On the Project Template step, leave the Project Template selected as **Empty Project**. Click **Next**.

    ![The New Project wizard with the Empty Project template selected.](images/empty-project.png)

4. On the Project Properties step, leave **Wiki Markup** as **Markdown** and click **Next**.

5. On the Project Team Members step, add other members of your team who will work with you on this visual application.

    As the project owner, you can control what others can do in this project by granting them membership as a Developer Full Access, Developer Limited Access, Contributor, or even as another Project Owner. For demonstration purposes, we'll add Clara Coder with the Developer Limited Access role, which lets her access most project components.

    * Enter the username of a teammate in the **Add Members** list.
    * Select a membership role.
    * Click **Add**. An email containing project details is sent to Clara Coder. To receive email notifications, the teammate's email address must be verified and notifications set properly in Preferences.

    Now click **Finish**.

    Wait for the project to be provisioned. Once provisioning completes, you'll see the Project Home page, which serves as a window to your workspaces, environments, and repositories, as well as a recent activities feed. On the left are a series of tabs showing the available project components.

    ![The Project Home page includes a Workspaces area, Environments area, and a Recent Activities feed. On the right, the Repositories tab, Statistics, and Team tabs are also visible.](images/project-home.png "Project Home page")

    Click ![Show/Hide Labels icon](images/show-hide-labels-icon.png) to hide the labels and increase screen space.

    Because we created a project with no preconfigured settings or content, we need to create what we need, by defining an environment that connects to a Visual Builder instance, then creating a workspace with a Git repository.

## Task 2: Create an environment with a Visual Builder instance

Define an environment that points to your Visual Builder development instance, where your visual application can be deployed from within the project.

1. On the Project Home page, click **+ Create Environment** under Environments.

    ![The Environments section on the Project Home page, showing the Create Environment button.](images/env-create.png)

2. Enter **Development** as the **Environment Name**, then optionally, add a description. Click **Create**.

3. On the Environments page, click **+ Add Instance** to add a Visual Builder instance to your **Development** environment.

    ![The empty Development environment shown on the Environments page. An Add Instance button is shown in the Service Instances tab. The Details and Certificates tabs are also visible.](images/env-add-instance.png "Environments page")

4. With **Instance Type** set to **Visual Builder and Oracle Integration** and **Authentication Method** set to **Identity Domain** in the Add Service Instances dialog, locate the Visual Builder instance in your tenancy. Once you find the instance you want to use, select it and click **Add**.

    ![The Add Service Instances dialog with myVBinstance of type Visual Builder IDCS Resource selected. An Add button is also shown.](images/env-add-service-instances.png "Environments page")

    **Note:** If the Visual Builder instance you want to use does not show up in the list of instances, select **Visual Builder Credentials** under **Authentication Method**, then enter the URL to your Visual Builder instance's home page (for example, http://yourserver/ic/builder) and the username and password of someone who can access that instance. Click **Add**.

    Wait for the instance's Status to turn green, from 'Unknown' to 'Available'.

5. Click ![Project Home icon](images/vbs-project-home-icon.png) **Project Home** in the left navigator to see your environment now defined.

## Task 3: Create a workspace for a visual application

You now need to create a workspace, a private area for you to work on your visual application. A workspace is typically associated with a Git repository where all your source files are stored.

1. On the Project Home page, click **Go to Workspaces** under Workspaces.

2. On the Workspaces page, click **New**, then select **New Visual Application**.

    ![The Workspaces page with New and New Visual Application options selected.](images/workspaces-new.png "Workspaces page")

3. In the New Visual Application dialog:

    * Enter **HR Workspace** as the **Workspace Name**.
    * Select **Development** (where you previously added a Visual Builder instance) as the **Development Environment**. If only one environment is available, it is automatically selected for you.
    * Leave **Default VBCS Application** as the **Visual Application Template**.
    * Click **Create new repository** under **Git Repository**, enter **tutorial-hr-project** as the **Repository Name** and **hrbranch** as the **Working Branch Name**.

    Click **Create**.

    Once your workspace is created, it opens on the Welcome page in the integrated development environment known as the Designer. The Welcome page is a launching point for creating apps, connecting to data, or adding artifacts. Before we proceed, let's take a tour of the Designer to better understand your workspace.

    ![This image shows part of the HR Visual Application's Welcome page. The page contains tiles in three sections: Connect to Data, Create Apps, and Add Artifacts. On  the right are sections with references to documentation and other resources.](images/visual-app-welcome.png "Welcome page in the Designer")

    On the left edge is a vertical toolbar with icons representing Web Applications, Service Connections, Business Objects, and so on. This toolbar is the Navigator, which helps you move between the artifacts in your visual application.

    Now take a look at the header:

    ![Header in the HR Visual Application workspace. The workspace name HR Visual Application is on the left. Next to it, the Git repository and current branch tutorial-hr-project.git / hrbranch are visible. On the right are icons that let you perform other actions: Undo, Redo, Preview, Publish Changes, Product Feedback, Go to File, and Menu.](images/header.png "Header")

    On the left is the name of your current workspace, **HR Workspace**. Next to it is the project's Git repository (**tutorial-hr-project.git**) and the branch currently associated with your workspace (**hrbranch**).

    The **tutorial-hr-project.git** repo stores your visual application's files and is known as your project's _remote_ repository. It includes the **main** and **hrbranch** branches, created with initial content for your visual application. The **main** branch is the default branch created when a new repo is generated and is the source from which your visual application is built. The **hrbranch** you see in your workspace is a working copy of the remote **hrbranch** and serves as your _local_ repository. It initially has the same set of source files as the remote branch, but as you work with your visual application, it will include the changes you make.

    Click the workspace and the Git repo/branch to see other actions that you can perform. Clicking ![Go to Project Page icon](images/go-to-project-home-icon.png) will take you back to the Project Home page.

    Elements on the right let you perform various other actions, such as undo changes or search the Git repository for a file. This workshop primarily demonstrates the options to preview your app, share it, and publish changes. If you make a mistake during this workshop, click ![Undo icon](images/undo-icon.png)  to back out of the last step you did, or the arrow next to it to undo more than one step.

    Take note of the footer, which has tools that help you debug and maintain your visual app (we'll briefly look at Audits and Git History in this workshop):

    ![Footer in the HR Visual Application workspace, which shows Audits, Find in Files, Git History, and Tests tabs.](images/footer.png "Footer")

    Keep in mind that VB Studio saves your changes automatically as you work. When you begin to make changes, a timestamp at the bottom of the page will show the time  your work was last saved. Note that changes are only saved to your local workspace repo—but more on that later.

    You are now ready to create a web app and may **proceed to the next lab**.
