# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop shows how you can use Oracle Visual Builder Studio to create a web app in a collaborative team environment. You'll see how easy it is to design a web app, manage its changes as part of a Git repository, and seamlessly deploy it for users—all within a short time.

Visual Builder Studio—VB Studio for short—is a visual development platform that helps your team plan and manage your application's lifecycle, right from design and develop through test and deploy. It provides a rich set of UI components that you can drag and drop in a visual designer to rapidly build engaging and responsive web apps. This intuitive approach lends itself to low-code developers, but experienced programmers can just as easily access the underlying source code and customize it for their requirements.

What's more, integrated Git repositories enable a collaborative environment to share and version code; Agile dashboards and issue tracking systems help teams track progress; and automated builds support continuous integration and delivery pipelines. A separate instance of Oracle Visual Builder provides publishing and database options when you’re ready to deploy your app. This means, you can publish your app instantly and access it on any device, anytime. You can even deploy it as a Progressive Web App (PWA), so it can be installed on the user’s device to tap into device capabilities such as camera and GPS.

All this makes VB Studio a complete solution to simplify application development and accelerate time to market. Take a look at this video to learn more, or just dive right into the labs.
