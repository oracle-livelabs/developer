# Save changes to a remote branch

## Introduction

This lab shows you how to save a web application's changes from your local branch to a remote branch, so others can view your work.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### About this Lab

While developing the HR web application, you might have noticed a yellow dot in the header next to the Git repository menu:

![Your Git repo in the header, tutorial-hr-project.git/hrbranch, shows with a yellow dot next to it.](images/git-changes-badge.png "")

This dot indicates changes in your local branch that haven't been saved to the remote branch, but what exactly does that mean?

When you first created a workspace with a branch called **hrbranch**, you created a _local_ repository that contains a working copy of **hrbranch**. The **hrbranch** initially had the same set of source files as the **main** branch, which is the default branch in your project's Git repo, also known as the _remote_ repository. As you worked on your visual application, all the changes you made to the HR web app were automatically saved to **hrbranch**, but these changes are not visible to others because this **hrbranch** is local to your workspace. To let others view your changes, you'll need to save your changes from the local branch in your workspace to a branch in the remote repository.

Saving changes to a remote branch is a two-step process: _commit_ and _push_. The first step you'll do is "commit". A commit groups the files in your local branch that you want to save to the remote branch and provides a description of the group. Next, you'll "push" your changes. A push saves all the files in the groups that you've "committed" to the remote branch.

Once you commit and push your changes, all the changes from your local **hrbranch** become available to others in your project through the remote **hrbranch**.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Commit your changes to the local repository
* Push your changes from the local to the remote repository

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* A Chrome browser
* All previous labs successfully completed

## Task 1: Commit changes in a local branch

Let's group the changes you've made so far in your local branch for a commit. Ideally, you'll commit your changes as often as you can, so you have a string of commits with messages that clearly describe your updates.

1. Click the Git repository menu in the header and select **Commit**.

    ![The Git repository options, when you click the menu in the header, include Commit, Cherry-Pick, Status, Diff, Pull, Push, Reset to Head, Merge, Stash, and Unstash. Some branch commands are also available.](images/commit-menu.png "")

2. In the Commit dialog box, enter a message that describes your changes and click **Commit**.

    ![The Commit dialog is shown with an example commit message. The Commit button is selected.](images/commit.png "")

    A successful message appears on the page, in the lower right corner. Click ![Close message icon](images/x-icon.png) to close the message.

## Task 2: Push changes to a remote branch

Push your commits from the local branch in your workspace to the remote branch.

1. Click the Git repository menu and select **Push**.
2. In the Push dialog box, you'll see 1 commit ready to be pushed from your local branch to the remote branch. Click **Push Changes**.

    ![The Push dialog, which identifies 1 commit ready to be pushed from the local hrbranch to the remote hrbranch, is shown. The Push Changes button is selected.](images/push-changes.png "")

    When the successful message appears, click ![Close message icon](images/x-icon.png).

## Task 3: View changes in the remote branch

Now that your changes have been pushed, let's check them in the remote **hrbranch**.

1. Click **Git History** at the bottom of your application window to view a summary of your push operation.

   ![The Git History panel is shown with the following columns: Action, Working Branch, Details, and Timestamp. The last Push operation is selected to show additional details on the right, such as date, author, working branch, and response. A Commit operation with subtasks under it and another Add operation also show.](images/git-history.png "")

   The Git History panel logs your Git actions and their results and is useful to keep track of what you've done in your workspace. Click ![Close message icon](images/x-icon.png) when you are done.

2. Now click ![Go to Project Page icon](images/go-to-project-home-icon.png) **Go to project page** in the header to return to the project's home page.

3. Click ![Git icon](images/git-icon.png) **Git** in the left navigator.

    You'll see your changes added to the remote **hrbranch**, indicated by your last commit message.

    ![The hrbranch in the repository is shown. With the Files tab selected, the latest commit message shows against the businessObjects / default folder at the top.](images/git-view-hrbranch.png "")

    Click **Logs** to see all commits to the remote branch.

    ![The Logs tab on the Git page is shown with details of all commits made to the remote hrbranch since the branch was first created.](images/git-view-hrbranch-logs.png "")

    Now if a teammate (for example, Clara Coder) wanted to work on this web application, she could use the **Clone From Git** option on the Workspaces page to clone hrbranch in her workspace, then use it as a base for her updates.

    You may **proceed to the next lab**.
