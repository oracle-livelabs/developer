# Add navigation between pages

## Introduction

This lab shows you how to set up navigation between pages in a web app.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### About this Lab

Now that your changes are committed to a remote branch, you'll want to continue updating your web pages to make sure users can navigate between the Department and Employee pages. You do this by adding buttons that perform specific _actions_ when you click them. In VB Studio, this sequence of actions is called an _action chain_. In this lab, you'll add buttons that take you from the Departments page to the Employees pages and back again. Each button is associated with an 'onclick' event that sets off a navigation action chain.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will set up navigation between web pages.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* A Chrome browser
* All previous labs successfully completed

## Task 1: Create an action chain to navigate from the Departments page to the Employees page

1. Click![Workspaces icon](images/vbs-workspaces-icon.png)**Workspaces**, then click **HR Workspace** in the Workspaces table.
2. Click ![Web Applications icon](images/web-applications-icon.png) **Web Applications**, then **main-departments** under the **hrwebapp** and **main** nodes.
3. In the Page Designer, click **Components** to open the Components palette. Enter `button` in the Filter field, then drag a **Button** onto the Toolbar, to the right of the Create Department button on the main-departments page.

    ![The main-departments page is shown, with a Button component being dragged from the Components palette into the toolbar, next to the Create Department button.](images/departments-button.png "")

4. Click **Properties** (if necessary) and in the General tab, change the **Label** field to `Show  Employees`.
5. Click the button's **Events** tab, then click the **\+ New Event** button. From the menu, select **On 'ojAction'**, the default action suggested for a button click.

    ![The New Event menu on a Button component's Events tab is shown. The On 'ojAction' option is selected.](images/departments-button-events.png "")

    An empty action chain with the ID ButtonActionChain is created.

6. In the Actions palette, scroll down to the **Navigation** section, then drag the **Navigate To Page** action onto the canvas.

    ![The Action Chain editor is shown, with the Navigate To Page action being dragged onto the canvas.](images/new-buttonactionchain.png "")

7. In the Navigate To Page action's properties, select **main-employees** from the **Page** list.

    ![The Action Chain editor is shown, with the Navigate To Page action, and main-employees under Peer Pages selected in the Page drop-down list.](images/departments-button-events-navigate.png "")

    The action now has the label **Navigate To Page main-employees**.

8. Click ![Preview icon](images/preview-icon.png) **Preview** in the header to run the page in its own browser tab and see how it will appear to a user. (You can use the Live mode to test your app if you prefer, though the Preview form factor is a bit more pleasing.)

9. In the new browser tab, click **Show Employees**.

    ![The Departments page is shown as it will appear to the user when you run the app.](images/preview.png "")

    You'll notice there's no way to get back to the main-departments page from the main-employees page, something we'll fix in the next task. Close the browser tab.

## Task 2: Create an action chain to navigate from the Employees page to the Departments page

1. In the Web Apps pane, click **main-employees** under the **hrwebapp** and **main** nodes.
2. Locate the **Button** component in the Components palette and drag it into the Toolbar, to the right of the **Create Employee** button.
3. In the button's Properties pane, change the **Label** field to `Show Departments`.
4. Click the **Events** tab, then click **+Â New Event** and select **On 'ojAction'**.

    Another empty action chain with the ID ButtonActionChain is created. Because this action chain is for a different page, it doesn't matter that it has the same name as the one for the main-departments page.

5. Drag the **Navigate To Page** action from the **Navigation** section onto the canvas.
6. In the Navigate To Page action's Properties pane, select **main-departments** from the **Page** list.

    The action now has the label **Navigate To Page main-departments**.

7. Now click ![Preview icon](images/preview-icon.png) **Preview**, then **Show Employees** in the new browser tab. Make sure you can get to the Departments page from the Employees page. Close the browser tab.
8. In the Web Apps pane, click **main**, then **Diagram** to view the application's modified page flow. You'll see bi-directional arrows flowing between the main-departments page and the main-employees page. Select the main-departments page tile to see ![Green navigation icon](images/diagram-navigation-icon-green.png) ![Black navigation icon](images/diagram-navigation-icon-black.png) navigation icons appear in the page's Properties pane, indicating that you can now navigate from main-departments to main-employees and back.

    ![The web app's main page flow is shown. The main-departments page points to both the main-create-department page and the main-employees page. The main-employees page points to the main-create-employee page. The main-departments page is selected to show more details in the Properties pane.](images/page-flow.png "")

   You may **proceed to the next lab**.
