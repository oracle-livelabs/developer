# Provision your instances

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the process of provisioning an Oracle Visual Builder Studio instance and a separate Oracle Visual Builder instance, assuming you don't already have both available to you. If you do, you can skip this lab and move on to the next one.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### About this Lab

If you just created a Cloud Account using the instructions in the previous lab, you might want to wait before you attempt to create Visual Builder and VB Studio instances. It could take anywhere between 10 and 30 minutes for a new user account to be fully provisioned (you'll get a email when provisioning is complete). If you already have a Cloud Account, you don't need to wait. Either way, make sure you've signed in to the Oracle Cloud as an Oracle Identity Cloud Service user before proceeding. *Note: If you log in using an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account, the navigation menu to Visual Builder won't show.*

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create an instance of Visual Builder
* Create an instance of VB Studio
* Connect your OCI account to your VB Studio instance (optional)

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle Cloud Account
* A Chrome browser

## Task 1: Create a Visual Builder instance

Provision a Visual Builder instance to host the web app you'll create in VB Studio. Visual Builder is a managed service that provides everything your apps need to run successfully, including a web server for hosting and to secure data access. You must provision the Visual Builder instance first, so you have it available for selection as a deployment target when you create a project in VB Studio.

1. To create a Visual Builder instance, you must first create a compartment. You can use the root compartment and the tenancy user that was created when the OCI account was created, but it's recommended to create a dedicated compartment to host the Visual Builder instance.

   a. On the Oracle Cloud Get Started page, click the menu ![Menu icon](images/hamburger.png) in the upper left corner.

   b. Select **Identity & Security**, then **Compartments**.

   ![This image shows navigation to Identity & Security, then Compartments under Identity.](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/id-compartment.png "")

   c. Click **Create Compartment**.

   ![This image shows a list of existing compartments on the Compartments page. The Create Compartment button is highlighted.](images/oci-compartments-create.png "")

   d. Enter `VBCompartment` as the name, add a description (for example, `VBCompartment for workshop`), and leave the Parent Compartment set to the default root compartment. Click **Create Compartment**.

   ![This image shows the Create Compartment dialog with fields filled in.](images/oci-compartments-vb-create-details.png "")

2. Return to the Oracle Cloud Get Started page and click the menu in the upper left corner.

   <!-- ![The hamburger menu on the Oracle Cloud Get Started page is highlighted.](images/hamburger.png "") -->

3. Select **Developer Services**, then **Visual Builder**.

    ![Navigation to Visual Builder under Developer Services is shown.](images/platform.png "")

4. In the **Compartment** field on the Visual Builder instances page, select the `VBCompartment` you created to host the Visual Builder instance, then click **Create Instance**.

    ![The Visual Builder Instances screen is shown, with the Compartment drop-down on the left and the Create Instance button on the right.](images/create-instance.png " ")

5. On the Create Instance screen, give your instance a unique name, one that is unlikely to be chosen by another user. Click **Create Visual Builder Instance**.

    ![Details of the Create Instance page is shown, with the Name, Compartment, and Nodes fields. The Create Visual Builder instance button is also shown.](images/detail.png "")

     When instance creation completes successfully, the instance shows as **Active** in the **Status** column. If you don't see the status change, try refreshing your browser.

    ![The newly provisioned Visual Builder instance is shown. Its state in the Status column is set to Active.](images/vb-instance-created.png " ")

## Task 2: Create a VB Studio instance

Provision a VB Studio instance to develop and deploy a web app. You can create only one VB Studio instance in an Oracle Cloud account. Before you attempt to create an instance, make sure your account has no other VB Studio instance provisioned.

1. In your Cloud Console, click the menu in the upper left corner, select **Developer Services**, then **Visual Builder Studio**.

   ![Navigation to Visual Builder Studio under Developer Services is shown.](images/oci-service-navigation-vbs.png "")

2. In the Compartment field on the Visual Builder Studio instances page, select your `root` compartment.

   ![The Visual Builder Studio Instances screen is shown, with the Compartment drop-down on the left set to the root compartment.](images/oci-compartments-selectroot.png "")

3. Click **Create Visual Builder Studio**.

    ![The Visual Builder Studio Instances page is shown, with the Create Visual Builder Studio  button highlighted.](images/create-instance-vbs.png "")

4. On the Instance Name screen, give your instance a unique name and make sure your root compartment is selected. Click **Next**.

   ![This image shows the Instance Name screen. The Instance Name is entered as vbstudio-devinstance and the Compartment field is set to root.](images/detail-vbs.png "")

5. On the CI/CD Setup screen, select your root compartment and make sure you select **Yes, I authorize this** to allow Oracle to create instances on your behalf. Click **Create Visual Builder Studio**.

   ![This image shows the CI/CD Setup screen, with the root compartment selected.](images/confirm-vbs.png "")

   When your instance is created, its details show in the Instance Info tab. You'll also receive an email with the subject **Verify your Oracle Visual Builder Studio email**. Make sure you click the URL link in the email body to verify your email. This is required to receive email notifications from VB Studio.

6. Now click **Service Console** to open Visual Builder Studio.

   ![This image shows the Instance Details page of the newly provisioned VB Studio instance, named vbstudio-devinstance. Under the instance name the Service Console button is highlighted.](images/vbs-instance-created.png "")

   The VB Studio console opens in a new browser tab, on the Organization page in the Projects tab.
   ![This image shows the landing page when VB Studio is opened.](images/vbs-home.png "")

   When you first log in, you see the Welcome page with a link to an introductory video, along with a news feed of additional screens. Close **X** to dismiss the news feed and expand your work area. Close the news banner prompt.

   Now is a good time to set your preferences. To do this, click the user initials in the upper right corner, and select **Preferences**. Use this page to change your display name, set an avatar, change the email address, or set email notification preferences. The email address (yours as well as that of any teammates you add to the project) must be verified and notifications set properly to be able to receive email.

   ![This image shows the options available when the User icon is clicked. Preferences is selected.](images/preferences.png "")

   You are now ready to create a project, but before you do that, you might want to check if your instance is preconfigured with a built-in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account, which lets you access resources to run builds in VB Studio. This free account isn't available in all OCI regions and data centers, so click the **OCI Account** tab to check if your instance includes it. If you see something similar to this image, it means your instance is connected to the built-in free account:

  ![This image shows the OCI Account tab when a free Built-in account is available. A Built-in Free section on the left shows the instance connected by default using this free account. On the right, a Connect Your Own section provides an option to connect your own OCI Account to the instance.](images/oci-free-account.png "")

  The free account provides a minimal set of resources (detailed [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/visual-builder/visualbuilder-administration/set-oracle-visual-builder-studio.html#GUID-759853ED-5561-4031-AC01-773D58992CA3)), sufficient to try out VB Studio. If this is enough for your needs, you can [jump to the next lab](#next) and get started with creating a project. If your data center does not include this free account or you want to explore more of VB Studio, continue with the following tasks to connect your own OCI account.

## Task 3: Set up the OCI account

To connect your VB Studio instance to OCI resources such as VMs for builds and storage buckets for project data, you need to set up your OCI account with a dedicated compartment and a separate Identity and Access Management (IAM) user. This allows you to organize VB Studio resources better because they aren't mixed with your other resources.

1. Create a separate compartment to host VB Studio resources:

   a. Return to your Oracle Cloud console, then click the menu in the upper left corner, select **Identity & Security**, then **Compartments**.

      ![This image shows navigation to Identity & Security, then Compartments, under Identity.](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/id-compartment.png "")

   b. Click **Create Compartment**.

      ![This image shows a list of existing compartments on the Compartments page. The Create Compartment button is highlighted.](images/oci-compartments-create-vbs.png "")

   c. Enter `VBStudioCompartment` as the Name, add a description (for example, `VBStudioCompartment for workshop`), and leave the Parent Compartment set to the default root compartment. Click **Create Compartment**.

   ![This image shows the Create Compartment dialog with fields filled in.](images/oci-compartments-create-details.png "")

2. Create a local user to access the compartment you've created:

      a. In the navigation menu, select **Identity & Security**, then under **Identity**, select **Users**.
      ![This image shows navigation to Identity & Security, then Users.](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/id-users.png "")

      b. Click **Create User**.
      ![This image shows a list of existing users on the Users page. The Create User button is highlighted.](images/oci-users-create.png "")

      c. Select the IAM user type, then enter `vbstudiouser` as the Name, add a description (for example, `User to access VBStudioCompartment`), and optionally, an email. Click **Create**.
      ![This image shows the IAM User selected on the Create IAM User page. The Name, Description, and Email fields are also filled in.](images/oci-users-create-details.png "")

3. On your computer, generate a private-public key pair in the PEM format:

    a. In the Console header, click the Developer tools icon ![Developer tools icon](images/oci-api-key-shell.png) and select **Cloud Shell**. Note that the OCI CLI running in the Cloud Shell will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started.

    b. Run the following commands in the cloud shell to generate a public and private key pair.

    ```text
    <copy>
    mkdir ~/.oci
    openssl genrsa -out ~/.oci/oci.api.key.pem 2048
    chmod go-rwx ~/.oci/oci.api.key.pem
    openssl rsa -pubout -in ~/.oci/oci.api.key.pem -out ~/.oci/oci.api.key.public.pem
    </copy>
    ```

    Here are the steps for reference:
    ![This image shows the results of the cloud shell commands with the commands to enter highlighted.](images/oci-api-key-shell-commands.png "")

    c. Run the following command to **copy the generated *public* key** and paste it in a text editor like notepad, we will need it for the next step.

    ```text
    <copy>
    cat ~/.oci/oci.api.key.public.pem
    </copy>
    ```

    d. Make sure to include ----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY---- and ----END PUBLIC KEY----

    ![This image shows the public key being copied to the clipboard through the right-click Copy option.](images/oci-api-key-shell-public-copy.png "")

    e. Run the following command to **copy the generated *private* key** and paste it in a notepad, we will need it later on.

    ```text
    <copy>
    cat ~/.oci/oci.api.key.pem
    </copy>
    ```

    f. Make sure to include ----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY---- and ----END RSA PRIVATE KEY----

    ![This image shows the private key being copied to the clipboard through the right-click Copy option.](images/oci-api-key-shell-private-copy.png "")

    g. Click **X**, then **Exit** to exit the cloud shell.

4. Upload the public key to the user's details page:

    a. On the **vbstudiouser** details page, scroll down and click **API Keys**, then click **Add Public Key**.
       ![This image shows the Add Public Key button highlighted on the vbstudiouser page, under API Keys.](images/oci-add-public-api-key.png "")

    b. Click **Paste Public Key** and paste the contents of the public key that you copied. Click **Add**, then **Close**.
      ![This image shows the Add Public Key dialog, with the public key added to the text area with the Paste Public Key option selected.](images/oci-paste-public-api-key.png "")

5. Create a group for the user who can access the VB Studio compartment and add the user to the group:

    a. In the navigation menu, select **Identity & Security**, then select **Groups** under **Identity**.
       ![This image shows navigation to Identity & Security, then Groups.](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/id-groups.png "")

    b. Click **Create Group**.

      ![This image shows existing groups on the Groups page. The Create Group button is highlighted.](images/oci-groups-create.png "")

    c. Enter `VBStudioGroup` as the Name, add a description (for example, `Group for VB Studio users`), and click **Create**.

      ![This image shows the Create Group dialog with Name and Description for a new VBStudioGroup.](images/oci-groups-create-details.png "")

    d. On the Group Details page, click **Add User to Group**.

      ![This image shows the Group Details page with Add User to Group highlighted.](images/oci-groups-addusertogroup.png "")

    e. Select the **vbstudiouser** and click **Add**.
       ![This image shows the vbstudiouser added in the Add User to Group dialog. The Add button is also shown.](images/oci-groups-addusertogroup-vbstudiouser.png "")

6. In the **root** compartment, create a policy to allow the group you created access to the VB Studio compartment:

    a. In the navigation menu, select **Identity & Security**, then select **Policies** under **Identity**.
       ![This image shows navigation to Identity & Security, then Policies.](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/id-policies.png "")

    b. Make sure the root compartment is selected in the Compartment list.
       ![This image shows the root compartment selected in the Compartment list.](images/oci-policies-rootselection.png "")

    c. Click **Create Policy**.
       ![This image shows a list of policies defined for the root compartment. The Create Policy button is highlighted.](images/oci-policies-create.png "")

    d. Enter `VBStudioPolicy` as the Name and add a description (for example, `Policy for VB Studio`). Make sure the root compartment is selected as the Compartment.

    e. Under Policy Builder, click **Show manual editor** and enter these statements:
       ```text
       <copy>
       Allow group VBStudioGroup to manage all-resources in compartment VBStudioCompartment
       Allow group VBStudioGroup to read all-resources in tenancy
       </copy>```
    f. Click **Create**.
       ![This image shows the Create Policy dialog with Name, Description, and Compartment. The Policy Builder is set to manual with two policy statements entered in the text area. The Create button is also shown.](images/oci-policies-create-details.png "")

## Task 4: Get OCI credentials

You now need the unique Oracle Cloud Identifiers (OCIDs) of the VB Studio compartment and user, as well as other details of your environment to help you connect VB Studio to OCI. You can get all this information from the Oracle Cloud console.

1. First, let's retrieve the Tenancy OCID, Home Region, and Storage Namespace. In the navigation menu, select **Governance & Administration**, then under **Account Management**, select **Tenancy Details**.

   ![This image shows navigation to Governance & Administration, then Tenancy Details.](images/oci-credentials.png "")

2. In a notepad, copy and paste the Tenancy OCID from the **OCID**, Home Region from the **Home Region**, and the Storage Namespace from the **Object Storage Namespace**.

   ![This image shows the OCID, Home Region, and Object Storage Namespace fields highlighted on the Tenancy Information page.](images/oci-credentials-tenancydetails.png "")

   Now, let's retrieve the User OCID and Fingerprint.

3. Click the navigation menu again and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity**, select **Users**.

   ![This image shows navigation to Identity & Security, then Users.](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/id-users.png "")

4. On the Users page, click the **vbstudiouser** you created.

   ![This image shows the vbstudiouser highlighted on the Users page.](images/oci-credentials-users.png "")

5. On the User Details page, copy the User OCID from **OCID** and paste it in notepad.

   ![This image shows the User OCID field for the vbstudiouser.](images/oci-credentials-user-ocid.png "")

6. To retrieve the fingerprint of the private-public key pair associated with the `vbstudiouser` account, scroll down to the Resources section, select API Keys, and copy the fingerprint value.

   ![This image shows the fingerprint of the vbstudiouser under API Keys.](images/oci-credentials-user-fingerprint.png "")

7. Now let's get the Compartment OCID. In the navigation menu, select **Identity & Security**, then **Compartments** under **Identity**.

   ![This image shows navigation to Identity & Security, then Compartments under Identity.](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/id-compartment.png "")

8. On the Compartments page, click **VBStudioCompartment**.
   ![This image shows the VBStudioCompartment highlighted on the Compartments page.](images/oci-credentials-compartments.png "")

9. Copy and paste the compartment's OCID to your notepad.
   ![This image shows the OCID field for the VBStudioCompartment.](images/oci-credentials-compartments-ocid.png "")

10. Finally, check for the private key. The private key file was generated and saved on your computer when you created the private-public key pair in the PEM format. As you recall, we copied the private key at the beginning of this lab and pasted it into a notepad. You'll now need this for the next task.

## Task 5: Connect the OCI account

With all the necessary information copied, connect your VB Studio instance to the OCI account.

1. Return to the VB Studio console, then on the Organization page, select **OCI Account** and click **Connect** (or **Connect OCI Account**).

   ![This image shows the OCI Account tab on the Organization page.](images/vbs-oci-tab.png "")

2. Use the information you've copied to fill out the Configure OCI Account page.

    * You can leave the Passphrase field empty because we generated the private-public key without a passphrase.
    * When you enter a private key, the Fingerprint field is automatically populated. Check whether this value matches the fingerprint value that you previously copied. If it doesn't, update it to enter the correct value.

3. Select the requirements check box, click **Validate**, then **Save**.

   ![This image shows the OCI Credentials dialog where you enter all the information you have gathered from different sources. In this screenshot, the information has been validated and a successful message shows for both compute and storage connections.](images/oci-account.png "")

    You may **proceed to the next lab**.
