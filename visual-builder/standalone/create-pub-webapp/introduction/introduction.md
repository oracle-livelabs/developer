# Introduction

## About this workshop

This workshop shows how to develop a web application in Oracle Visual Builder for your users to view, create, and edit data. You'll see how to create a new web app, add pages to display your data, then link them to each other. Along the way, you'll create business objects to store your app's data as well as create a connection to an external REST service to access its data, then build pages to edit that data.

Estimated Time: 115 minutes

### What is Oracle Visual Builder?
Oracle Visual Builder—as the name suggests—is a visual development tool that helps you create responsive web and mobile applications. It provides a rich set of UI components that can be simply dragged and dropped, making it easy for you to rapidly build complete and engaging UIs. It also serves as a unified platform that allows you to define your own data objects as well as access data from external REST-based sources. So you can create reusable business objects that implement your app’s business logic and store its data, pick data objects exposed by an integrated catalog of Oracle REST services, or pull data from any external REST service with just a few clicks.

Visual Builder is a development tool as well as a hosting platform—which means you can publish your app instantly and access it on any device, anytime. What's more, you can deploy your app as a Progressive Web App (PWA), so it can be installed on the user’s device (Android and iOS) to tap into device capabilities such as camera and GPS.
