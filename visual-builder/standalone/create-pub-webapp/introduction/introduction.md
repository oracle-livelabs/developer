# Introduction

## About this workshop

This workshop shows you how to develop a web application in Oracle Visual Builder that lets users view, add, and edit employee data. You'll see how easy it is to create a web app and design pages with modern UI components to display your data. You'll also create business objects to store your app's data as well as connect to a third-party REST service to access its data.

Estimated Time: 115 minutes

### What is Oracle Visual Builder?

Oracle Visual Builder—as the name suggests—is a visual development tool that helps you create responsive applications. It provides a rich set of UI components that can be simply dragged and dropped, making it easy for you to rapidly build engaging UIs. It's also a unified platform that allows you to define your own data objects as well as access data from external REST-based sources. So you can create business objects that implement your app’s business logic and store its data, pick data objects exposed by an integrated catalog of Oracle REST services, or pull data from any external REST service with just a few clicks.

Because Visual Builder is a development tool as well as a hosting platform, you can publish your app instantly and access it on any device, anytime. What's more, you can deploy your app as a Progressive Web App (PWA), so it can be installed on the user’s device to tap into device capabilities such as camera and GPS.
