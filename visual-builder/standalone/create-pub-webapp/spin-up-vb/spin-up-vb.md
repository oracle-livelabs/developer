# Provision an instance

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the process of provisioning an instance of Visual Builder, assuming you don't already have one available to you.  If you do, you can skip this lab and move on to the next one.

Estimated Time:  5 minutes

  **Note:** If you have access to Oracle Integration, you can use the Visual Builder instance provisioned in Oracle Integrationâ€”though an administrator must first enable it. See [how to enable Visual Builder for your Oracle Integration instance](https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/cloud/paas/application-integration&id=ABCAG-GUID-592A60FD-C6B7-4E65-8AC5-05253EF2A026).

### About this lab

If you just created a new Cloud account following the instructions in Getting Started, you must wait at least 30 minutes before you attempt to create an instance of Visual Builder. It could take anywhere between 10 and 30 minutes for a new user account to be fully provisioned (you'll get a email when provisioning is complete). If you already have a Cloud account, you don't need to wait. Either way, make sure you've signed in to the Oracle Cloud as an Oracle Identity Cloud Service user before proceeding. *If you log in using an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account, the navigation menu to Visual Builder won't show.*

### Objectives

In this lab, you will create an instance of Visual Builder.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle Cloud Account
* A Chrome browser

## Task 1: Create a compartment

Visual Builder instances use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) as underlying infrastructure. To connect your Visual Builder instance to OCI resources, you need a dedicated compartment. While you can use the `root` compartment for your Visual Builder, it's recommended that you create a dedicated compartment to better organize and isolate your Visual Builder resources.

1. On the Oracle Cloud Get Started page, click the menu ![Menu icon](images/hamburger.png) in the upper left corner.

2. Select **Identity & Security**, then **Compartments** under Identity.

    ![This image shows navigation to Identity & Security, then Compartments under Identity.](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/id-compartment.png "")

3. Click **Create Compartment**.

   ![This image shows a list of existing compartments on the Compartments page. The Create Compartment button is highlighted.](./images/oci-compartments-create.png "")

4. Enter a name (for example, `VBCompartment`) and add a description (`VBCompartment for workshop`). Leave the Parent Compartment set to the default and click **Create Compartment**.

  ![This image shows the Create Compartment dialog, with Name set to VBCompartment, Description set to VBCompartment for workshop, and Parent Compartment set to <tenancyName> (root).](./images/oci-compartments-create-details.png "")

   A new **VBCompartment** appears in the Compartments table.

## Task 2: Create an instance

1. From the navigation menu, click **Developer Services**, then select **Visual Builder**.

    ![This image shows navigation to Visual Builder under Developer Services](images/platform.png "")

2. Switch to the compartment you created for Visual Builder resources: Click the **Compartment** filter next to Applied filters, select **VBCompartment**, and click **Apply filter**. Click **Create Visual Builder instance**.

   ![The Instances screen is shown, with the Compartment filter set to VBCompartment and the Create Visual Builder instance button under it.](images/create-instance.png " ")

3. On the Create instance screen, give your instance a unique name, one that is unlikely to be chosen by another user. Leave all other fields as is for the purposes of this tutorial. Click **Create Visual Builder instance**.

   ![This image shows details of the Create instance page, with the Name set to myVisualBuilder, Consumption model set to Metered (Universal Credit), Compartment set to VBCompartment, and Nodes set to 1. The right bottom corner shows the Create Visual Builder instance button.](images/detail.png "")

    When instance creation completes successfully, the instance shows as **Active** in the Status column. If you don't see the status change, try refreshing your browser.

   ![The newly provisioned Visual Builder instance is listed on the Instances page, with its status set to Active.](images/vb-instance-created.png " ")

4. Click the instance's name on the list of instances to view its details, then click **View Service Home Page** to open Visual Builder in a new browser tab.

   ![This image shows the details page of the newly provisioned Visual Builder instance, named myVisualBuilder, which shows information such as Created, Last Edit Date, OCID, Nodes, and Compartment. A View Service Home Page on the top right is highlighted.](images/view-vb.png "")

  You're now in the Visual Builder console and can **proceed to the next lab**.
