# Add pages to interact with your mobile app's data

## Introduction

This lab shows you how to use the Quick Starts provided with Oracle Visual Builder to generate pages, buttons, and swipe actions that enable you to view, edit, and delete data in a mobile application.

Estimated Time:  10 minutes

### About this lab

Oracle Visual Builder provides Quick Starts that create pages to help you quickly build your mobile application. Quick Starts facilitate the creation of pages to display, create, edit, and delete data. You can invoke the Quick Start you want to use when you select the appropriate component in the page. Typically, this is a List View component when you develop a mobile application.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Add pages to view, edit, and delete data
* Test your pages

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* A Chrome browser
* All previous labs successfully completed

## Task 1: Add a Detail page for the Department business object

1. In the HR Application, click the **Mobile Applications** ![Mobile Apps icon](./images/mobapp_icon.png) tab in the Navigator.
2. If necessary, expand the **flows** and **main** nodes, then click **main-departments**.
3. In the Page Designer, click the **Structure** tab and select **List View**.
4. In the Properties pane, click the **Quick Start** tab, then click **Add Detail Page**.
5. On the Select Endpoint page, select **Department** under Business Objects if necessary and click **Next**.

    ![Shows the Select Endpoint page of the Add Detail page quick start. The Department business object is selected.](./images/dept-add-detail-qs.png)

6. On the Page Details page, under Endpoint Structure, select **name** and **location**, in that order, and click **Finish**.

    ![Shows the Page Details page of the Add Detail page quick start. the name and location fields are selected.](./images/dept-add-detail-select-fields.png)

    The main-department-detail page is created, and a selection event is configured for the List View component on the main-departments page. This selection event navigates users who tap a list item on the main-departments page to the main-department-detail page where they can view more detail about the selected department.

7. To view the Department Detail page, click **Live** for the main-departments page, then select a department. Click the **Structure** tab to make room for your view.

    ![Shows the Department Detail page, showing the Name and Location fields.](./images/detailfinal.png)

## Task 2: Add an Edit page for the Department business object

1. Return to the main-departments page and click **Design**. If necessary, select the **List View** component in the **Structure** view.
2. In the Quick Start menu, click **Add Edit Page**.
3. On the Select Read Endpoint and Select Update Endpoint pages of the Quick Start, select **Department** under Business Objects.
4. On the Page Details page, select **location** under Endpoint Structure (**name** is already selected), and click **Finish**.
5. Click the **main-department-detail** page.
6. Click the **Components** tab, then drag a **Button** component to the right of the Department Detail page title, until you see the pop-up with the available slots. Drop the button in the **Right Side** slot. The Button component appears to the right of Department Detail in the Page Designer.

    ![Shows the canvas of the mobile app with a Button component being dragged into the Right Side slot. ](./images/deptdetail.png)

7. On the **General** tab of the Button's Properties pane, enter `Edit` in the **Text** field.
8. Click the **Events** tab for the button, click **\+ New Event,** and then select **Quick Start: 'ojAction'** from the menu.

    ![Shows the button's Events tab in the Properties pane. The + New Event button is selected to show the Quick Start ojAction option.](./images/button-events.png)

    An action chain with the `ButtonActionChain` ID is created. It contains only the **Start** action.

9. Drag the **Navigate** action from the **Navigation** section of the **Actions** palette to the **+** sign that the Start action points to. From the **Target** drop-down list, select **main-edit-department**.

    ![Shows the Navigate action added to the Action Chain. On the right the properties shows the Target drop-down list, with main-edit-department selected.](./images/button-navigate-action.png)

    The action now has the label `Navigate main-edit-department`.

10. To map the source variables in the main-department-detail page to the target parameters in the main-edit-department page, click **NOT MAPPED** under **Input Parameters**.

    ![Shows the properties pane of the Navigate action, with departmentId under Input Parameters. The mouse is placed over the parameter's Not Mapped message.](./images/mapvar.png)

11. In the Assign Input Parameters dialog box, drag a line from the **departmentId** variable in the **Sources** list to the **departmentId** parameter in the **Target** list, and click **Save**.

    ![Shows the Assign Input Parameter dialog. The departmentId variables under Page on the Sources side is selected and mapped to the departmentId under Parameters on the Target side.](./images/mapvarpar.png)

## Task 3: Add a Delete action for the Department business object

1. Go to the main-departments page, and if necessary click the **List View** component in the **Structure** view.
2. In the Quick Start menu, click **Add Delete Action**.
3. On the Select Endpoint page of the Quick Start, select **Department** under Business Objects and click **Finish**.
4. In the Properties pane, click the **General** tab. Under **Swipe Actions**, drag the handle for the **Delete** action from **Right Side end** to **Left Side start**.

    ![Shows the List View's properties under Swipe Actions. The Delete action icon is being draged from the Right side end to the Left Side start section.](./images/swipe_pi.png)

## Task 4: Test your new Department pages

1. Click **Preview** ![Preview icon](./images/run_icon.png).

    The application opens in another browser tab or window.Â For now, ignore the message about not having any build configurations or PWA settings for this app.

2. On the Departments page, click **Administration** to open the Department Detail page. Make sure you click near the Id field to open the detail page.

    ![Shows the mouse placed on the Edit link on the Department Detail page.](images/test_dept_detail.png)

3. Click **Edit** to change the record.
4. On the Edit Department page, enter `Top Floor` in the **Location** field, and then click **Save**.

    A confirmation message is displayed, and the application navigates back to the Department Detail page. The change that you just made appears in the Department Detail page.

5. To return to the Departments page, click the Back icon ![Back button cion](./images/backbutton.png).
6. If you have a touch screen environment, swipe from the left edge of the screen to the right . A **Delete** button appears.

    When you click **Delete** in a desktop browser environment that does not have a touch screen, the action is ignored. When you tap **Delete** on a device with a touch screen, the swiped list item is deleted.

    ![Shows the department on the Departments page with the Delete icon on its left edge, indicating it is ready to be deleted.](./images/swipe_rt.png)

7. Swipe from the right edge of the screen to the left. An **Edit** button appears. As with the **Delete** button, the swipe action requires a touch screen environment to function.
8. Close the tab or window.

   You may **proceed to the next lab**.
