# Oracle Spatial  

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps of creating spatial table with column type SDO\_GEOMETRY. We will see how to insert data into the tables and also add spatial metadata to tables.

**Below lab is completed and spatial data is already loaded into the tables.**


### Before You Begin

This lab assumes you have completed the following labs:
- Lab 1:  Login to Oracle Cloud
- Lab 2:  Generate SSH Key
- Lab 3:  Create Compute instance 
- Lab 4:  Environment setup
  
## Task 1: Create spatial tables

We have created tables and spatial metadata for CUSTOMERS, WAREHOUSES and WAREHOUSES\_DTP 
Notice that each has a column of type SDO\_GEOMETRY to store location. 


   ````
    <copy>
    CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS                                             
(
  CUSTOMER_ID NUMBER(6, 0),
  CUST_FIRST_NAME VARCHAR2(20 CHAR),
  CUST_LAST_NAME VARCHAR2(20 CHAR), 
  GENDER VARCHAR2(1 CHAR), 
  CUST_GEO_LOCATION SDO_GEOMETRY, 
  ACCOUNT_MGR_ID NUMBER(6, 0)
);  


CREATE TABLE WAREHOUSES                                           
(
WAREHOUSE_ID NUMBER(3,0), 
WAREHOUSE_NAME VARCHAR2(35 CHAR), 
LOCATION_ID NUMBER(4,0), 
WH_GEO_LOCATION SDO_GEOMETRY); 



CREATE TABLE "WAREHOUSES_DTP" 
(       "WAREHOUSE_ID" NUMBER, 
	"WAREHOUSE_NAME" VARCHAR2(30), 
	"LOCATION_ID" NUMBER, 
	"DRIVE_TIME_MIN" NUMBER, 
	"GEOMETRY" "SDO_GEOMETRY"
);

    </copy>

## Task 2: Add spatial metadata

Next we added Spatial metadata for the CUSTOMERS, WAREHOUSES and WAREHOUSES\_DTP 
tables to the USER\_SDO\_GEOM\_METADATA view. Each SDO\_GEOMETRY column is registered with a row in USER\_SDO\_GEOM\_METADATA.


````
    <copy>
 EXECUTE SDO_UTIL.INSERT_SDO_GEOM_METADATA (sys_context('userenv','current_user'), -
 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUST_GEO_LOCATION', -  SDO_DIM_ARRAY(SDO_DIM_ELEMENT('X',-180, 180, 0.05), - SDO_DIM_ELEMENT('Y', -90, 90, 0.05)),-  4326);

EXECUTE SDO_UTIL.INSERT_SDO_GEOM_METADATA (sys_context('userenv','current_user'), -
'WAREHOUSES', 'WH_GEO_LOCATION', - SDO_DIM_ARRAY(SDO_DIM_ELEMENT('X',-180, 180, 0.05), - SDO_DIM_ELEMENT('Y', -90, 90, 0.05)),-  4326);

Insert into user_sdo_geom_metadata values (
'WAREHOUSES_DTP','GEOMETRY',MDSYS.SDO_DIM_ARRAY(MDSYS.SDO_DIM_ELEMENT('X', -180, 180, 0.05), MDSYS.SDO_DIM_ELEMENT('Y', -90, 90, 0.05)),4326);
      </copy>
    
````

     
**Here is a description of the items that were entered:**

-	TABLE-NAME: Name of the table which contains the spatial data.
-	COLUMN-NAME: Name of the SDO-GEOMETRY column which stores the spatial data.
-	 MDSYS.SDO-DIM-ARRAY: Constructor which holds the MDSYS.SDO-DIM-ELEMENT object,which in turn stores the extents of the spatial data  in each dimension (-180.0, 180.0), and a tolerance value (0.05). The tolerance is a round-off error value used by Oracle Spatial, and is in meters for longitude and latitude data. In this example, the tolerance is 5 mm.
-	4326: Spatial reference system id (SRID): a foreign key to an Oracle dictionary table  (MDSYS.CS-SRS) tha  contains all the     supported coordinate systems. It is important to associate your customer's location to a coordinate system. In this example, 4326    corresponds to "Longitude / Latitude (WGS 84).".


We have inserted spatial data and we have used two spatial functions for this.
 
- We use sdo\_cs.transform() to convert to our desired coordinate system SRID of 4326, and 
- We use sdo\_geom.validate\_geometry() to insert only valid geometries.


## Task 3: Sample insert query 

Below is the sample insert query-

````
    <copy>
Insert into WAREHOUSES (WAREHOUSE_ID,WAREHOUSE_NAME,LOCATION_ID,WH_GEO_LOCATION) values (1,'Speedway Facility',1400,MDSYS.SDO_GEOMETRY(2001, 4326, MDSYS.SDO_POINT_TYPE(-86.2508, 39.7927, NULL), NULL, NULL));
    </copy>
    
```` 

The elements of the constructor are: 
-	2001: SDO\_GTYPE attribute and it is set to 2001 when storing a two-dimensional single point such as a customer's location.
-	4326: This is the spatial reference system ID (SRID): a foreign key to an Oracle dictionary table (MDSYS.CS\_SRS) that contains all the supported coordinate systems. It is important to associate your customer's location to a coordinate system. In this example, 4326 corresponds to "Longitude / Latitude (WGS 84)."
-	MDSYS.SDO-POINT-TYPE: This is where you store your longitude and latitude values within the SDO\_GEOMETRY constructor. Note that you can store a third value also, but for these tutorials, all the customer data is two-dimensional.
-	NULL, NULL: The last two null values are for storing linestrings, polygons, and geometry collections. For more information on all the fields of the SDO\_GEOMETRY object, please refer to the Oracle Spatial Developer's Guide. For this tutorial with point data, these last two fields should be set to NULL.
