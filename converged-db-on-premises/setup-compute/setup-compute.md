      - **Name**:  Enter a name  or keep the prefilled default (*DO NOT ENTER ANY SPECIAL CHARACTERS HERE*, including periods, underscores, exclamation etc, it will mess up the configuration and you will get an error during the apply process)
      - **Description**:  Same as above
      - **Create in compartment**:  Select the correct compartment if not already selected

     ***Note:*** *If this is a newly provisioned tenant such as freetier with no user created compartment, stop here and first create it before proceeding.*
7.  Click **Next**.

  ![](./images/em-create-stack-2.png " ")

8. Enter or select the following:
    - **Instance Count:** Accept the default, **1**, unless you intend to create more for a team for instance
    - **Select Availability Domain:** Select an availability domain from the dropdown list.
    - **SSH Public Key**:  Paste the public key you created in the earlier lab

    ***Note:*** *If you used the Oracle Cloud Shell to create your key, make sure you paste the pub file in a notepad, remove any hard returns.  The file should be one line or you will not be able to login to your compute instance*
9. Depending on the quota you have in your tenancy you can choose from standard Compute shapes or Flex shapes.  We recommend standard shapes unless you have run out of quota (Please visit the Appendix: Troubleshooting Tips for instructions on checking your quota)
    - **Use Flexible Instance Shape with Adjustable OCPU Count?:** Keep the default as checked (unless you plan on using a fixed shape)
    - **Instance Shape:** Keep the default ***VM.Standard.E3.Flex*** as selected, the only option for Flex shapes.
    - **Instance OCPUS:** Accept the default (**4**) This will provision 4 OCPUs and 64GB of memory. You may also elect to reduce or increase the count in the range [2-24]. Please ensure you have the capacity available before increasing.
10. If you prefer to use fixed shapes, follow the instructions below.  Otherwise skip to the next step.
    - **Use Flexible Instance Shape with Adjustable OCPU Count?:** Unchecked
    - **Instance Shape:** Select VM.Standard.E2.4 (this compute instance requires at least 30 GB of memory to run, make sure to choose accordingly)

  ![](./images/standardshape.png " ")

11. For this section we will provision a new VCN with all the appropriate ingress and egress rules needed to run this workshop.  If you already have a VCN, make sure it has all of the correct ingress and egress rules and skip to the next section.
    - **Use Existing VCN?:** Accept the default by leaving this unchecked. This will create a **new VCN**.

12. Click **Next**.
13. Review and click **Create**.

  ![](./images/em-create-stack-3.png " ")

14. Your stack has now been created!  

  ![](./images/em-stack-details.png " ")

You may now proceed to Step 2 (skip Step 1B).

## Task 1B: Create Stack:  Compute only
If you just completed Step 1A, please proceed to Step 2.  If you have an existing VCN and are comfortable updating VCN configurations, please ensure your VCN meets the minimum requirements.  
- Ingress rules for the following ports:  3000, 3001, 3003, 1521, 7007, 9090, 22

  ![](images/df56bc989ad85f9bfad17ddb6ed6038e.jpg " ")

To save all your settings:

3.  In the category section, **Click** session.
4.  In the saved sessions section, name your session, for example ( EM13C-ABC ) and **Click** Save.

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.  

## Appendix:  Terraform and Resource Manager
Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.  Configuration files describe to Terraform the components needed to run a single application or your entire datacenter.  In this lab a configuration file has been created for you to build network and compute components.  The compute component you will build creates an image out of Oracle's Cloud Marketplace.  This image is running Oracle Linux 7.

Resource Manager is an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service that allows you to automate the process of provisioning your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Using Terraform, Resource Manager helps you install, configure, and manage resources through the "infrastructure-as-code" model. To learn more about OCI Resource Manager, take a watch the video below.

- Limits Exceeded
- Invalid public key
- Flex Shape Not Found

### Issue 1: Availability Domain Mismatch
![](images/error-ad-mismatch.png  " ")

#### Issue #1 Description
When creating a stack and using an existing VCN, the availability domain and the subnet must match otherwise the stack errors.  

#### Fix for Issue #1
1.  Click on **Stack**-> **Edit Stack** -> **Configure Variables**.
2.  Scroll down to the network definition.
3.  Make sure the Availability Domain number matches the subnet number.  E.g. If you choose AD-1, you must also choose subnet #1.
4.  Click **Next**
5.  Click **Save Changes**
6.  Click **Terraform Actions** -> **Apply**

### Issue 2: Invalid public key
![](images/invalid-ssh-key.png  " ")

#### Issue #2 Description
When creating your SSH Key, if the key is invalid the compute instance stack creation will throw an error.

#### Tips for fixing for Issue #2
- Go back to the instructions and ensure you create and **copy/paste** your key into the stack correctly.
- Copying keys from Cloud Shell may put the key string on two lines.  Make sure you remove the hard return and ensure the key is all one line.
- Ensure you pasted the *.pub file into the window.
1.  Click on **Stack**-> **Edit Stack** -> **Configure Variables**.
2.  Repaste the correctly formatted key
3.  Click **Next**
4.  Click **Save Changes**
5.  Click **Terraform Actions** -> **Apply**

### Issue 3: Flex Shape Not Found
![](images/flex-shape-error.png  " ")

#### Issue #3 Description
When creating a stack your ability to create an instance is based on the capacity you have available for your tenancy.

#### Fix for Issue #3
If you have other compute instances you are not using, you can go to those instances and delete them.  If you are using them, follow the instructions to check your available usage and adjust your variables.
1. Click on the Hamburger menu, go to **Governance** -> **Limits, Quotas and Usage**
2. Select **Compute**
3. These labs use the following compute types.  Check your limit, your usage and the amount you have available in each availability domain (click Scope to change Availability Domain)
4. Look for Standard.E2, Standard.E3.Flex and Standard2
4.  Click on the hamburger menu -> **Resource Manager** -> **Stacks**
5.  Click on the stack you created previously
6.  Click **Edit Stack** -> **Configure Variables**.
7.  Scroll down to Options
8.  Change the shape based on the availability you have in your system
9.  Click **Next**
10. Click **Save Changes**
11. Click **Terraform Actions** -> **Apply**

### Issue 4: Limits Exceeded
![](images/no-quota.png  " ")

#### Issue #4 Description
When creating a stack your ability to create an instance is based on the capacity you have available for your tenancy.

*Please ensure that you are NOT running this in the **Always Free** Tier. This workshop does not run on the Always Free tier, you must have available cloud credits.  Go to **Governance** -> **Limits, Quotas and Usage,** select **compute**, ensure that you have **more than** the micro tier available.  If you have only 2 micro computes, your account has transitioned to an Always Free.  This means that the promotional period of 30 days has expired or you have run out of credits, this workshop will NOT run.*

#### Fix for Issue #4
If you have other compute instances you are not using, you can go to those instances and delete them.  If you are using them, follow the instructions to check your available usage and adjust your variables.

1. Click on the Hamburger menu, go to **Governance** -> **Limits, Quotas and Usage**
2. Select **Compute**
3. These labs use the following compute types.  Check your limit, your usage and the amount you have available in each availability domain (click Scope to change Availability Domain)
4. Look for Standard.E2, Standard.E3.Flex and Standard2
5. This workshop requires at least 4 OCPU and a minimum of 30GB of memory.  If you do not have that available you may request a service limit increase at the top of this screen.  If you have located capacity, please continue to the next step.
6.  Click on the Hamburger menu -> **Resource Manager** -> **Stacks**
7.  Click on the stack you created previously
8.  Click **Edit Stack** -> **Configure Variables**.
9.  Scroll down to Options
