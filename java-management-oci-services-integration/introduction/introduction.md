# Introduction

## About Java Management Service

Java Management Service (JMS) is a reporting and management infrastructure integrated with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Platform services to observe and manage your use of Java SE (on-premises or in the Cloud).

In addition to core JMS functions on the Oracle Cloud console, customers can perform various functions on JMS using OCI APIs, the OCI Command Line Interface (CLI) and JMS Software Development Kits (SDKs). With these tools, customers can obtain additional insights about their use of Java SE to aid decision making when managing Java workloads.

Watch the video below for an introduction to Java Management Service and a brief demo.

As a customer, you can:

- Use insights from OCI APIs to further understand and optimize your workloads across your enterprise (desktop, server, cloud); and
- Protect your Java SE investments by identifying outdated Java installations and unauthorized applications.

JMS helps systems administrators to answer questions such as:

- What are all the versions of Java I have running in development and production?
- Which vendors are providing the Java installations in my environment?
- Are my applications using their intended Java installations?
- Are unauthorized applications running?
- How many outdated Java installations do I have?

As the stewards of Java, Oracle can provide answers to these questions. Oracle uniquely leverages its expertise to gain critical insights into Java application behavior, compliance, and performance.

## About this Workshop

This workshop is a follow up workshop to the [Manage Java Runtimes, Applications and Managed Instances Inventory with Java Management Service](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=912) workshop, which we recommend to be completed before beginning this workshop about Integrating OCI Services with Java Management Service.

This workshop will walk you through the process of setting up and using various Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services for use with Java Management Service (JMS) on OCI. It will first walk you through the set up and use of the OCI Command Line Interface (CLI) to access JMS APIs. It will then walk you through the set up and use of JMS Software Development Kits (SDKs) and Postman to use the JMS APIs.


_Estimated Time:_ 45 minutes

### Objectives
* Access REST API via OCI CLI
