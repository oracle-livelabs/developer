### Objectives

In this 3 part workshop, you will:

* Provision a Kubernetes cluster, Oracle Autonomous Database, a Container Registry, and an API Gateway
* Understand, build, and deploy a Java tier implementing the REST APIs, using the SpringBoot framework, Docker, the OCI Container Registry, and a Kubernetes service
* Understand, build, and deploy a Telegram Bot frontend/UI making calls to the SpringBoot service implementing the REST APIs. The solution also has a React JS front that you can deploy over an OCI Object storage bucket.
