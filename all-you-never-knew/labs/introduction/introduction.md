# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop is a companion for the "Everything You Never Knew About Oracle" developer showcase at Oracle Cloud World 2025.  If you enjoyed the live demo, and you'd like to try it for yourself, or share it with your colleagues, this workshop will allow you to do that! 

Estimated Time: 120 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will be provided with a Customer Service application that you will extend while you learn how to:

* Build microservices using **Spring Boot** and **Oracle Database**
* Use **Oracle Universal Connection Pool** to improve availability
* Use **Oracle Autonomous Database** in the OCI Free Tier, and **Oracle Database for Developers**, low-cost options for cloud database development
* Build REST APIs using Spring Boot
* Handle events with **Oracle Transactional Event Queues** to implement event-based capabilities
* Use OKafka to implement atomic, transactional messaging
* Use **Oracle AI Vector Search** and **OCI Generative AI** service to implement AI summarization and recommendations
* Use **JSON Relational Duality Views** to reduce round trips and improve application performance
* Create REST APIs using **Oracle REST Data Services**


### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An **Oracle Database 23ai** running in OCI (see ["Get Started"](/developer/all-you-never-knew/workshops/tenancy/index.html?lab=get-started) to get one) 
* An Integrated Development Editor (like Visual Studio Code)
* The necessary tools and runtimes to build Spring Boot applications, including Maven and a Java Developer Kit (JDK 21 recommended)
