# Introduction

## **About Oracle Database 19c** ##

Oracle Database 19c provides the most advanced SQL engine on the planet. It complies with the latest ISO SQL standard, making it not only the most comprehensive database but also the most open one. It supports highly sophisticated analytics alongside and with no impact on OLTP workloads, eliminating the need to develop and orchestrate complex, fragile, and inconsistent data movement between different specialized data stores. Oracle’s SQL engine ships with integrated machine learning algorithms and allows developers to easily apply them on the data directly, hence moving the computation to the data—rather than having to pull the data out of the database and perform the calculation within the application. Using this capability, developers can create real-time prediction models directly on the data itself and act on insights more quickly and easily than ever before.

Oracle Database 19c supports fully consistent data with ACID transaction guarantees and consistent queries. This greatly simplifies application development compared to NoSQL stores. Native JSON support makes up a cornerstone for flexible schema support and Internet of Things (IoT)workloads, enabling developers to simply load JSON documents into the database natively and analyze them later on, with the full power of Oracle SQL. Oracle’s PL/SQL engine is yet another powerful tool for bringing computations to the data and providing an easy and standardized interface to them via simple SQL function or procedure calls. Interfaces such as REST allow for easy communication and integration with Oracle Database. These can be created automatically on top of tables, as well as stored procedures, giving developers the flexibility on how and what data to expose to consuming services.

Extend this with the move to autonomy provided by Oracle Autonomous Database, a self-driving, self-securing, and self-repairing approach where the database itself decides on the steps to perform for the best of the user's workload or data. Machine learning algorithms are used to help the database to decide how to tune a workload, how to secure the data, and how to take countermeasures to preserve the agreed-on SLA levels.

With the Oracle Autonomous Database, developers can fully concentrate on the applications they write and the business’s requirements, rather than having to think about the data tier. And to make this even easier the Oracle Autonomous Database environment can be provisioned in minutes with a few simple clicks or an API call to the Oracle Cloud.
