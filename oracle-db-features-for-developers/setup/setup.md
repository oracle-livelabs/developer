# Sample Schema Setup

## Introduction
This lab will show you how to setup your database schemas for the subsequent labs.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will setup sample schema:
* Set the environment variables
* Get the Database sample schemas and unzip them
* Install the Sample Schemas

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:

* A LiveLabs Cloud account and assigned compartment
* The IP address and instance name for your DB19c Compute instance
* Successfully logged into your LiveLabs account
* A Valid SSH Key Pair

## Task: Install Sample Data

In this step, you will install a selection of the Oracle Database Sample Schemas.  For more information on these schemas, please review the Schema agreement at the end of this lab.

By completing the instructions below the sample schemas **SH**, **OE**, and **HR** will be installed. These schemas are used in Oracle documentation to show SQL language concepts and other database features. The schemas themselves are documented in Oracle Database Sample Schemas [Oracle Database Sample Schemas](https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=COMSC).

1. Run a *whoami* to ensure the value *oracle* comes back.)

    >**Note:** If you are running in Windows using putty, ensure your Session Timeout is set to greater than 0.
    
    ```
    <copy>whoami</copy>
    ```

2. If you are not the oracle user, log back in:
    ````
    <copy>
    sudo su - oracle
    </copy>
    ````

    ![substitute user oracle](./images/sudo-oracle.png " ")

4.  Set the environment variables to point to the Oracle binaries.  When prompted for the SID (Oracle Database System Identifier), enter **ORCL**.
    ````
    <copy>
    . oraenv
    </copy>
    ORCL
    ````
    ![environment variables](./images/oraenv.png " ")

5. Get the Database sample schemas and unzip them. Then set the path in the scripts.

    ````
    <copy>
    wget https://github.com/oracle/db-sample-schemas/archive/v19c.zip
    unzip v19c.zip
    cd db-sample-schemas-19c
    perl -p -i.bak -e 's#__SUB__CWD__#'$(pwd)'#g' *.sql */*.sql */*.dat
    </copy>
    ````

    ![install schema](./images/install-schema-zip.png " " )

6.  Login using SQL*Plus as the **oracle** user.  

    ````
    <copy>
    sqlplus system/Ora_DB4U@localhost:1521/orclpdb
    </copy>
    ````
    ![start sqlplus](./images/start-sqlplus.png " ")

7.  Install the Sample Schemas by running the script below.

    ````
    <copy>
    @mksample Ora_DB4U Ora_DB4U Ora_DB4U Ora_DB4U Ora_DB4U Ora_DB4U Ora_DB4U Ora_DB4U users temp /home/oracle/db-sample-schemas-19c/ localhost:1521/orclpdb
    </copy>
    ````

    ![schema installed](./images/schemas-created.png " " )

8. Exit SQL Plus and exit the oracle user to return to the opc user.

    ```
    <copy>exit
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

    ![return to opc](images/return-to-opc.png)

Congratulations! Now you have the environment to run the labs.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
