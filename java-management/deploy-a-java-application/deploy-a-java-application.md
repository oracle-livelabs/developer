# Deploy a Java application

## Introduction

This workshop walks you through the steps to deploy a simple Java Application in a Compute Instance.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:

* Create a Compute Instance
* Install Java on Compute Instance
* Deploy a simple Java application

### Prerequisites

* You have signed up for an account with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and have received your sign-in credentials.
* You are using an Oracle Linux image on your host machine or compute instance for this workshop.
* Access to the cloud environment and resources configured in the previous workshop

## Task 1: Create a Compute Instance

1. Sign in to the Oracle Cloud Console as an administrator using the credentials provided by Oracle, as described in [Signing into the Console](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signingin.htm).
&nbsp;

2. Use the **Create a VM Instance** wizard to create a new compute instance. The wizard does several things when installing the instance.
    * Creates and installs a Compute Instance running Oracle Linux.
    * Creates a VCN with the required subnet and components needed to connect your Oracle Linux instance to the internet.
    * Creates an `ssh` key pair you use to connect to your instance.


3. To get started installing your Compute Instance with the **Create a VM Instance** wizard, follow these steps:
  From the main landing page, select **Create a VM Instance** wizard.
    ![image of quick actions menu on the main landing page](images/action-menu.png)

    The **Create Compute Instance** page is displayed. It has a section for **Placement**, **Image and shape**, **Networking**, **Add SSH keys**, and **Boot volume**.

    Choose the **Name** and **Compartment**. Select the compartment created previously.

    **Initial Options**
    * **Name**: `<name-for-the-instance>`
    * **Create in compartment**: `<your-compartment>`

      It is important for Compute Instance to be created in a Compartment with correct set of Policies. So, select the `Fleet_Compartment` Compartment if you selected Onboarding Wizard option in Lab 1, otherwise select the Compartment that you have created.

      ![image of selecting correct compartment for the Compute Instance](images/select-correct-compartment.png)

    Enter a value for the name or leave the system supplied default.

    Review the Placement settings. Take the default values provided by the wizard. The following is sample data. The actual values change over time or differ in a different data center.

    **Placement**
    * **Availability domain**: AD-1 (For Free Tier, use **Always Free Eligible** option)
    * **Capacity type**: On-demand capacity
    * **Fault domain**: Oracle chooses the best placement

    Review the **Image and shape** settings. Take the default values provided by the wizard.

    **Image**
    * **Image**: Oracle Linux 8
    * **Image build**: Default image build
    * **Shape**: Any AMD or Intel shape
    * **OCPU count**: 1
    * **Memory (GB)**: 1
    * **Network bandwidth (Gbps)**: 0.48

    > **Note:** Usage of Ampere shapes is not recommended for Java Management Service as they are not supported.

    Review the **Networking** settings. Take the default values provided by the wizard.

    **Virtual cloud network**: vcn-'date'-'time'
    * **Subnet**: subnet-'date'-'time'
    * **Assign a public IPv4 address**: Yes

    Review the **Add SSH** keys settings. Take the default values provided by the wizard.

    Select the **Generate a key pair for me** option.

    Click **Save Private Key** and **Save Public Key** to save the private and public SSH keys for this compute instance.

    If you want to use your own SSH keys, select one of the options to provide your public key. Put your private and public key files in a safe location. You cannot retrieve keys again after the compute instance has been created.

    Review the **Boot volume** settings. Take the default values provided by the wizard.

4. Click **Create** to create the instance. Provisioning the system might take several minutes.

5. You have successfully created an Oracle Linux instance.

## Task 2: Access Instance via SSH

1. Open the navigation menu and click **Compute**. Under **Compute**, click **Instances**.

  ![image of console navigation to instance](images/console-navigation-instance.png)

2. Click the link to the Instance you created in the previous step.

3. From the **Instance Details** page look under the **Instance Access** section. Write down the public IP address the system created for you. You use this IP address to connect to your Instance.

4. Open a **Terminal** or **Command Prompt** window.
  Change into the directory where you stored the ssh encryption keys you created.
  Connect to your instance with this SSH command
    ```
    <copy>
    ssh -i <your-private-key-file> opc@<x.x.x.x>
    </copy>
    ```    
5. Since you identified your public key when you created the instance, this command logs you into your Instance.

## Task 3: Install Java 8 and create a simple Java application

### For **Linux**

1. Install JDK 8 (64-bit) in your Instance.
  Install Oracle JDK 8 using `yum`.
    ```
    <copy>
    sudo yum -y install jdk1.8.x86_64
    java -version
    </copy>
    ```
    > **Note:** Management Agents require JDK 8 and superuser privileges for installation.

2. Java is installed.

3. Build your Java application.

  In the **Terminal** window, create a Java file by entering this command:
    ```
    <copy>
    sudo nano HelloWorld.java
    </copy>
    ```

  In the file, paste the following text:

    ```
    <copy>
    public class HelloWorld {
      public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException{
        System.out.println("This is my first program in java");
        int number=15;  
        System.out.println("List of even numbers from 1 to "+number+": ");  
        for (int i=1; i<=number; i++) {  
          //logic to check if the number is even or not  
          //if i%2 is equal to zero, the number is even  
          if (i%2==0) {
            System.out.println(i);
            Thread.sleep(2000);
          }
        }  
      }//End of main
    }//End of HelloWorld Class
    </copy>
    ```

4. To save the file, type **CTRL+x**. Before exiting, nano will ask you if you wish to save the file: Type **y** and **Enter** to save and exit, type **n** to abandon your changes and exit.

### For **Windows**

1. Install JDK 8 in your instance.
  Visit the [official Oracle page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java8-windows) to download Java 8. Download the x64 installer `jdk-8u<VERSION>-windows-x64.exe`.

  Run the downloaded file and follow the instruction of installer. Leave default options, take note of the jdk installation path.

  Set environment variables on your system: Right-click on **My Computer** -> **Properties** -> **Advanced system settings** (on the top-left) -> **Environment Variablesâ€¦** button on the bottom -> double-click on **Path** of **System variables** part of form. -> **New**-> paste paths for jdk and jre **bin** folder (for example: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0\_161\bin; C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0\_161\bin).

  Set the **JAVA\_HOME** environment variable. To set it, go to **System variables** form -> click **New** -> enter **JAVA\_HOME** for **Variable name:** and **path/to/jdk** for **Variable value:** (for example: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_161).

  To check if Java has been installed, in **Command Prompt** window, enter the following command. Make sure to open a new Command Prompt as the recent changes in environment variables may not be reflected in previous Command Prompt winodws.
    ```
    <copy>
    javac -help
    </copy>
    ```
    There should be a list of options. Now, enter the following:

    ```
    <copy>
    java -version
    </copy>
    ```

2. If there is information about your Java runtime, Java is installed.

3. Build your Java application.

  In the **Command Prompt** window, create a java file by entering this command:
    ```
    <copy>
    notepad HelloWorld.java
    </copy>
    ```
  In the file, paste the following text:
    ```
    <copy>
    public class HelloWorld {
      public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException{
        System.out.println("This is my first program in java");
        int number=15;  
        System.out.println("List of even numbers from 1 to "+number+": ");  
        for (int i=1; i<=number; i++) {  
          //logic to check if the number is even or not  
          //if i%2 is equal to zero, the number is even  
          if (i%2==0) {
            System.out.println(i);
            Thread.sleep(2000);
          }
        }  
      }//End of main
    }//End of HelloWorld Class
    </copy>
    ```

4. Go to the File option and click the Save button to save the file. Close the notepad window. Move to the command prompt window again.



## Task 4: Shutdown the Instance


Do remember to stop your Compute Instance after you are done running it to conserve resources and reduce charges. If you are using an always free tier Compute Instance, there are no associated charges.

You may now **proceed to the next lab.**

## Troubleshoot Java application deployment issues

**For Task 2**

* If you encounter a permissions error similar to the following:
    ```
    Permissions 0644 for '<your-keyfile-name>.key' are too open.

    It is required that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.
    ```
  You will need to assign read and write permissions to your key. Enter the following:

    ```
    <copy>
    chmod 400 ./<your-private-key-file>
    </copy>
    ```

**For Task 3**

* If you encounter an error similar to the following:
    ```
    No match for argument: jdk1.8.x86_64
    ```
  Please use a new instance with AMD or Intel shape instead of Ampere.
