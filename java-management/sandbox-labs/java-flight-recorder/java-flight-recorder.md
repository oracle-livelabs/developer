# Run Java Flight Recorder (JFR)

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to run Java Flight Recorder on a Java application running in a fleet un order to collect diagnostic and profiling data for the application. 

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Run Java Flight Recorder (JFR) on a Java application running in the fleet and download the resulting recording

### Prerequisites

* You have signed up for an account with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and have requested workshop reservation on LiveLabs.
* A running compute instance with preloaded Java Runtimes and Java applications (already created for you) that you will be monitoring.
* Access to the cloud environment and resources configured in [Lab 1](?lab=setup-a-fleet) and [Lab 2](?lab=install-management-agent-script).

## Task 1: Run Java Flight Recorder (JFR) on a Java application

**Submit a Crypto Event Analysis Work Request**

1. Open the navigation menu, click **Observability & Management**. Click **Fleets** under **Java Management**. Select the fleet that was created in [Lab 1](?lab=setup-a-fleet).

2. Scroll down the Fleet details page. Under **Resources** menu, select **Managed instances**. You should see the Managed instance set up in [Lab 3](?lab=install-management-agent-script). Click on the managed instance.

4. In the **Java Flight Recorder** (JFR) Window, select **Recording option: Select from default profiles**

    Under the **Select default profiles**, click on the dropdown menu and select **Default.jfc**

    Lower the **Max recording duration** to 5 mins and keep **Max recording size** at 500MB. Click **Start** to begin the JFR recording.

    >**Note:** The application should run longer than the duration of the JFR specified.
