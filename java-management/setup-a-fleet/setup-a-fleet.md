# Set up a Fleet

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to set up a new fleet in Java Management Service (JMS).

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Set up a Fleet using the Java Management Service user interface
* Create and configure an install key for installing Management Agents on your host machine

### Prerequisites

* You have signed up for an account with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and have received your sign-in credentials.
* You are using an Oracle Linux image on your host machine or compute instance for this workshop.

## Task 1: Set Up Java Management Service Fleet

1. In the Oracle Cloud Console, open the navigation menu, click **Observability & Management**, and then click **Fleets** under **Java Management**.

2. Select the compartment created for JMS resources in Lab 1 (Compartment name should be **Fleet_Compartment**) and **Create Fleet**.

3. In the Create Fleet dialog box, enter a name for the Fleet Name (for example, `fleet_1`), and a description.

4. Select **Create New Management Agent Configuration**.

5. Click **Show Advanced Options**.

6. Under **Advanced Options**:

  If you would like to keep the default name of the Install key, no changes are needed, or else deselect **Use Fleet Name** for Install Key Name and enter an alternative name for the management agent install key, for this example, enter "management-agent-install-key-fleet-1".

  In the **Maximum Installations** field, specify a number that indicates the maximum number of installations that can be associated with the key. For this example enter **10**.

  In the **Valid For** field, specify a number that indicates the period for which the key is valid. The default value is 1 Year.

7. Click **Next**.You are prompted to review the fleet information and management agent configuration. If you wish to modify your choices, click **Previous**.

8. Click **Create**. This creates a new fleet and a new management agent install key using the information you provided.

9. Click **Download Install Key** to download the install key. The install key is issued against your identity domain and validates the authenticity of the installation.

  Click **Done** once the download is complete. The downloaded file will be used in [Lab 5: Install Management Agent on non-OCI Hosts - Linux](?lab=set-up-of-management-agent-linux) to install the Management Agent.

10. After JMS is linked to the management agent, it will collect information on your Java runtimes. As the management agent will scan the instance periodically, the information may not appear immediately. The scanning frequency can be changed here.

11. Click the fleet. In the detail page, click on **Modify Agent Settings**.

12. Change the **Java Runtime Discovery** and **Java Runtime Usage** to the desired value. For this example, change **Java Runtime Discovery** to **3 hours**, and **Java Runtime Usage** to **5 minutes**.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
