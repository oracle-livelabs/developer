Messy data buries meaning. Keywords miss the mark. Customers, employees, and analysts waste time chasing the right document, product, or answer.

AI Vector Search in Oracle Database 23ai fixes that. It stores embeddings—the numeric “fingerprints” of meaning—inside the database. With them, you find what things mean, not just what words they contain. That makes Vector Search a foundation for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic workflows, where LLMs need fast, accurate access to trusted enterprise data.

What you gain with Vector Search in Oracle Database 23ai:

- **Semantic search:** Discover documents, products, and images by meaning, not spelling.

- **One platform:** Blend vectors with relational, JSON, and graph data in Oracle Database 23ai.

- **Speed at scale:** Use HNSW indexes and efficient distance metrics (cosine, Euclidean, dot product).

- **Enterprise strength:** Count on Oracle’s security, manageability, and recovery.

- **AI-ready workflows:** Power RAG, recommendations, deduplication, and clustering.

- **Multimodal power:** Apply the same search to text, images, or any embedding.

- **Simpler stack:** Keep search and data together—cutting latency, risk, and cost.

This QuickStart shows you how similarity search works, how distance functions shape results, and how you can bring these capabilities into real applications with simple code.
