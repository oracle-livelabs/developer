# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop you will learn how a Python-based web application built atop the Flask micro-framework can use pre-existing <b>O</b>racle <b>R</b>EST <b>D</b>ata <b>S</b>ervices (ORDS) <b>A</b>pplication <b>P</b>rogramming <b>I</b>nterfaces (APIs) to serve, display, and catalogue data and customer orders of a sample web application.

We will explore key concepts related to ORDS APIs such as:
- Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) APIs
- Modules
- Templates
- Handlers 
- Methods 

We will also discuss Python libraries used in this Workshop, like: 
- Flask 
- Folium 
- Json 
- Requests

We will also briefly discuss Bootstrap - a popular html and CSS framework Bootstrap, and select JavaScript functions.
