## Task 1: Obtain code for this Workshop

1. Navigate to [this repository]().
2. If you have an existing GitHub account you may choose to fork the repository for this Workshop. 
    - Alternatively, you may choose to download the contents of this Workshop as as `.ZIP` file. 

  ![Retrieve the Workshop code from GitHub](images/retrieve-code-from-git-hub.png)

3. Once you have forked the repository (or installed locally through the ZIP option), the contents should look similar to this: 

    ![Reviewing the folders in VS Code](images/review-folders-for-flask-app.png)

    At a <i>minimum</i> you'll want to ensure you have a `static` folder, `templates` folder, and the Python application `app.py`.

:bulb: <i>For details on how to run a Flask application in a Virtual Environment (venv), refer to the [Installation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/installation/) and [Quick Start](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/quickstart/) steps in the Flask documentation.</i>

## Task 2: Review the Python application and functions

1. Locate your Python application.

    Once you have located the Workshop contents (either forked or saved locally), open the <b>app.py</b> file inwith your preferred editor. This Workshop uses Visual Studio Code (VS Code or VSC) for file editing/review.

    ![Opening the Python application](images/right-click-to-open-app.png)

2. Review the libraries included in this application. 

    Once the application loads into your editor, notice the libraries we've imported to allow this application work: 

    ![Imported libraries for Python application](images/imported-libraries-for-application.png)

    You may have used these libraries in other projects as they are popular in Python application development. Libraries include: 
    - Folium
      - plugins
      - JavaScriptLink
      - Tooltip
      - Icon
    - Flask
      - Flask 
      - Json
      - render_template
      - request
      - redirect
      - jsonify
    - requests
    - json 

3. Review the Python application

    Beginning with the first line in our code you'll see we have created an instance of the `Flask` class: 

      ```app = Flask(__name__)```

    You may have seen this before, but in this case the argument `(__name__)` is sufficient, for a small scale application as this. You may review the selected documentation on this subject in the "Learn More" section of this lab.

4. Review the Folium contents of the application

    Here you'll see several parts to the Folium section of the application. 
    1. We set the initial, base Folium map = `m`
      - You'll also notice we've included starting coordinates, set minimum and maximum zoom properties, as well as a visual presentation option (i.e. "Stamen Toner")
    2. We include a tooltip; which you'll later when we load the application 
    3. Next we rely on the "Requests" library to `GET` json from our Autonomous Database, via ORDS APIs
      - We perform an iteration to gather the necessary information for populating our map
    4. We'll then create individual markers for the museum locations we retrieved from our database 
      - Here we'll pass the latitude and longitude coordinates
      - We'll then include information pop-ups for all the museums
        - Notice how we include the `museum_name` as HTML, the icon color and type, along with `tooltip`

      <i>:bulb: **Note:** The tooltip generates a helpful bubble when hovered over that reads "Click me!"; you'll see it soon enough.</i>

    5. Finally you'll see the line: 
    `lvmap = m._repr_html_()`
    We include this to temporarily save our map as a HTML iframe (this includes all necessary HTML and JavaScript properties), which we'll later use as an argument in our application's index page (in Flask)

5. Review our application routes

    If you are familiar with Flask, then you'll know all about routes. You may skim this section to become acquainted with the behavior of the application. If not, here is the primer: application routes (aka `app.route()`) are triggered when actions are performed in the application. 
    
    In some cases the results of a function may be passed back to the user, in other cases a new HTML page may load, in other cases the user may be redirected to a new page.
    
    In all cases, you'll notice that an ORDS endpoint is used for either a `GET` or `POST` method.

    #### The Routes 

    1. `@app.route('/')`
          
        ![The Index route](images/app-route-index.png)

        This route contains the `index()` function. When a user navigates to the home page they'll be presented with the `index.html` page. We are also including our newly constructed Folium map, `lvnmap` as an argument. 
      
        We'll review the HTML pages shortly so you can view all functions and their output in context.

    2. `@app.route('/get_price')`

        ![The Get Price route](images/app-route-get-price.png)
    
        The function of this route `getPrice()` appends `a` to an ORDS endpoint. From there we retrieve product prices from a product table. This will be one of the fields we'll use in a drop-down menu (found on the `orderform.html` page).
        
        You'll notice the final line in this function `return jsonify(product_price)` which takes the response and converts it to the JSON format while also assigning it a mimetype of "application/json". Later, we'll review this route along with a JavaScript function, to learn how they work in tandem with our ORDS endpoint. 

    3. `@app.route('/get_description')`

        ![The Get Description route](images/app-route-get-description.png)
    
        Much like the `get_price` app route, this function requests product description information from our database. It uses a similar syntax as before. We then `return jsonify(product_description)` which takes the response and converts it like before. 
    
    4. `@app.route('/orderform')`

        ![The Order Form route](images/app-route-order-form.png)
    
        Using a separate ORDS endpoint, our application performs a more typical `GET` request. Here we return a list of products, along with the `orderform.html` page. You'll notice how we set some of these items similar, but not quite the same, names. This is done for the benefit of the associated JavaScript we'll rely on. We'll review this in the next lab. 

    5. `@app.route('/orderhistory')`

        ![The order history route](images/app-route-order-history.png)

        Performing a `GET` request to this endpoint will return the items in a table that stores customer order history. While this particular application doesn't cover credentialing of individual customers, the aim is to showcase the ease of retrieving <i>specific</i> customer data with relative ease.

        You'll see how this app route is triggering in the `orderform.html` page. 

    6. `@app.route(/result', methods = ['POST', 'GET'])`

        ![The result route](images/app-route-result.png)

        Using the same ORDS endpoint as the `orderhistory` app route, we can infer that this route expects a `POST` request originating from the Flask application. This function also performs actions such as establishing the key:value pairs of the incoming data, and the JSON payload headers well. 

        In short, this function is triggered by the submit action on the `orderform.html` page. But rather than staying on that page, the user is redirected to the `orderhistory.html` page. 
      
      7. You may now proceed to the next Lab.
