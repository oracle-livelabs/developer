# Lab 1: Walk-through of Flask application and Oracle REST APIs

## Introduction

In this Lab, you'll obtain the code needed for the Flask application. We'll briefly review how to start Flask. We'll then step through this application's three main `HTML` pages.

The main focus of this Lab will be discovering the flexibility and extensibility of Oracle REST APIs. Throughout this Lab, we will discuss the interactions between Oracle REST APIs and the Flask application.

This Lab will cover topics including:

- Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) APIs
- **`GET`** request query parameters
- Example **`POST`** requests with cURL commands
- The Flask framework

Estimated Time: 25 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

### Objectives

In this Lab, you will:

- Obtain all code necessary to complete the Workshop
- Review the Flask application's core functions/operations
- Review the application's relationship with Oracle REST APIs

### Prerequisites

- such as Visual Studio Code or similar application
- Flask installation
- Virtual environment installation

This Lab assumes you have:

- All previous labs successfully completed

## Task 1: Obtain code for this workshop

1. [Download the ZIP](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/labfiles/flask-ords-lab-main.zip) file that contains our the Flask application and associated `HTML` files

2. Once downloaded, un-compress the ZIP file and open it (examples in this Workshop will use Visual Studio Code). The contents in your directory should be configured like the image below:

    ![Reviewing the folders in VS Code](images/review-folders-for-flask-app.png " ")

> üí° For details on how to run a Flask application in a Virtual Environment (venv), refer to the [Installation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/installation/) and [Quick Start](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/quickstart/) steps in the Flask documentation.

## Task 2: Activate the virtual environment

While the main focus of this Workshop is not to introduce you to Flask, we will periodically review specific practical actions for the developer. 

> üí° Stuck? Review the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/installation/#) documentation, then return to this Lab once you are more comfortable with Flask operations.

1. Open your terminal.

   ![Open New Terminal in VS Code](images/open-terminal-in-vs-code.png " ")

   Commands are different for macOS/Linux and Windows. Alternatively, if using VS Code, we recommend you follow [these instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask) on how to install Python virtual environments in VS Code (once complete, come back to this Lab).

    > üÜò If  your Virtual Environment fails to start in VS Code, check your Python Interpreter!

    You can check the interpreter by:

      1. Navigating to your Command Palette

         ![Navigating to the Command Palette.](images/command-palette-action.png " ")

      2. Searching for and selecting *Python: Select Interpreter*

         ![Select Interpreter action.](images/python-select-interpreter-action.png " ")

      3. Selecting the Python Interpreter associated with the Virtual Environment

         ![Activating the Virtual Environment.](images/selecting-the-venv-python-interpreter.png " ")

2. If you choose to activate the virtual environment *manually*, use the following commands to activate:

    macOS/Linux

    ```bash
    <copy>. .venv/bin/activate</copy>
    ```

    Windows

    ```bash 
    <copy>.venv\Scripts\activate</copy>
    ```

3. You should now see the prefix (or similar to) **`(.venv)`** in your terminal:

   ![Opening the Python application](images/verify-venv-is-active.png " ")

## Task 3: Install and activate Flask

1. You can now install the Flask application in your virtual environment. Use the following command:

   ```bash
    <copy>pip install Flask</copy>
    ```

2. Next, we'll start the Flask Application with Debug mode enabled. Debug mode allows you to view your changes in the browser, without having to restart your development server. Enter the following command:

    ```bash
    <copy>flask --app lab_1_app run --debug</copy>
    ```

3. Once the development server is live, right-click the server IP address to open the Flask application. The application will automatically open in your default browser.

    ![Right-click development server address](images/right-click-ip-for-flask-app.png " ")

## Task 4: Explore and personalize the application

1. Once the Flask application loads, the home screen will appear.

    ![The index page in portrait view](images/initial-page-load.png " ")

   üèó But first, let's personalize this Welcome page.

2. Notice the filler text at the top of the **`index.html`** page. Let's customize that to make this application unique *to you*.

    ![Observing the filler text at the top of the page.](images/index-page-portrait-view.png " ")

3. Return to your editor and expand the **`templates`** folder. There you'll find the **`index.html`** file. Select it.

    ![Navigating to the templates folder and the index page.](images/navigate-to-templates-folder-index-file.png " ")

4. Scroll down till you see the **`<div class="card-body">`** container on Line 12. Change the text in Lines 13-14 to something of your choosing.

    ![Changing the card body text to something unique.](images/change-card-body-text.png " ")
    *<sub>Once satisfied, save the file.</sub>*
    ![The updated text in the index template.](images/updated-card-body-text-index-template.png " ")

5. Return to the browser window where the Flask application is displaying. And reload the page.

    ![Reloading the Flask page to reflect changes in the index template.](images/updated-text-in-flask-application.png " ")

6. You should now see the updated text from the **`index`** template. Congratulations, you've just personalized the application!

## Task 5: Review the basic HTTPS operations

1. You can explore the navigation tab (hamburger icon on the upper right-hand corner).

    ![Hamburger icon for additional resources](images/index-page-hamberder-icon.png " ")

2. Expand it, and you'll find helpful Oracle REST API resources.

    ![Additional resources accessed from within the hamburger menu icon.](images/additional-resources-found-in-the-hamberder-icon.png " ")

3. But we'll first explore the *Folium* map at the bottom of this **`index`** page.

   > üß† *Folium "makes it easy to visualize data manipulated in Python on an interactive Leaflet.js map. Manipulate your data in Python, then visualize it on a Leaflet map via Folium...It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations and passing rich vector/raster/HTML visualizations as markers on the map. To expand your knowledge of Folium and Leaflet.js, see the "Learn More" section for more details.*

4. When in Folium map, you can interact with location markers - these represent various attractions in the downtown Las Vegas area.  

    - Each marker will have a **Tool-tip**; when hovered over, the user can choose to click it to reveal additional information:

    ![Folium tool-tip focus](images/folium-tool-tip-focus.png " ")

    - When clicked, these markers reveal an attraction's name.

   > üòÄ *Here is where we first encounter Oracle REST APIs. You'll see the code in a later Lab, but for now, we'll show you, in the browser, the API responsible for providing us with this map's information.*

5. Next you'll review this Oracle endpoint.

   Copy the following URI.

    ```html
    <copy>https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/museums/</copy>
    ```

   Now place it into your browser's address bar and press Enter. You should see the **`items`** from the **`GET`** request:

   ![ORDS API results in browser](images/ords-results-in-browser.png " ")

   > üòÄ *This* **`GET`** request is where the Folium map *`GET`s* its input.

6. Manipulating the **`GET`** request with query parameters.

   Take that same URI, add these query parameters to the end (as can be seen in the image below).

     ```html
     <copy>?q={"$orderby":{"museum_lat":"ASC"}}</copy>
     ```

   Enter it into your browser's address bar, and press Enter.

   ![Updated address](images/ords-endpoint-with-ascending-query-parameter.png " ")

   Once the page reloads, you'll the results.

   ![ORDS API results in ascending order by latitude](images/ords-api-results-ascending-latitude.png " ")

   > ‚ùì **What do you notice?** If you caught that the venues are all ordered in ascending order, according to their latitudes, you'd be correct!

7. Try another. Take that original URI, and add these parameters to the end:

    ```html
    <copy>?q={"museum_lat":{"$between":[36.05,36.15]}}</copy>
    ```

    Enter it into your browser's address bar, press enter, and review the results:

      ![Selected ORDS results by latitude](images/ords-api-results-select-latitudes.png " ")

    > ‚ùì **What do you see now?** You can probably tell by now, but we've restricted our results to a narrow band of latitudes.

    The ability to perform myriad **`GET`** requests with a single API + query parameters is powerful. But we can manipulate other HTTPS Operations (Methods) too! Let's take a look at a **`POST`** request.

8. Add a location using the **`POST`** request.

   We've created a Resource Handler for this table that can be used for the **`POST`** operation/method. Let's add another location to a table.

    1. We'll do this next step in a terminal. First, begin by copying the appropriate cURL command for your environment.

        - Command Prompt:

            ```bash
            <copy>curl -v -X POST ^
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/museums/" ^
            -d "{\"MUSEUM_NAME\":\"<VALUE>\",\"MUSEUM_LOCATION\":\"<VALUE>\",\"MUSEUM_LAT\":\"<VALUE>\",\"MUSEUM_LONG\":\"<VALUE>\",\"message\":\"<VALUE>\"}"</copy>
            ```

        - Power Shell:

            ```shell
            <copy>curl.exe -v -X POST `
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/museums/" `
            -d "{\"MUSEUM_NAME\":\"<VALUE>\",\"MUSEUM_LOCATION\":\"<VALUE>\",\"MUSEUM_LAT\":\"<VALUE>\",\"MUSEUM_LONG\":\"<VALUE>\",\"message\":\"<VALUE>\"}"</copy>
            ```

        - Bash:

            ```bash
            <copy>curl --location --request POST \
            'https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/museums/' \
            --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            --data-binary '{
            "MUSEUM_NAME": "<VALUE>",
            "MUSEUM_LOCATION": "<VALUE>",
            "MUSEUM_LAT": "<VALUE>",
            "MUSEUM_LONG": "<VALUE>",
            "message": "<VALUE>" 
            }'</copy>
            ```

    2. Next, choose some **`{Key: Values}`** that adhere to the datatypes Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) expects. *Be sure to choose something unique* so you can quickly identify it. Review this table for what our database table expects:  

        | Key               | Value's Data Type  | Example Value                                 |
        | ----------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
        | `MUSEUM_NAME`     | VARCHAR2(500 BYTE) | "Henry's Old Time Saloon Museum" <sup>a</sup> |
        | `MUSEUM_LOCATION` | VARCHAR2(500 BYTE) | "123 Tipsy Ave." <sup>a</sup>                 |
        | `MUSEUM_LAT`      | NUMBER(8,6)        | 50.000000 <sup>b<sup>                         |
        | `MUSEUM_LONG`     | NUMBER(9,6)        | 100.000000 <sup>c</sup>                       |
        {: title="`{Key:Value}` Reminder Table"}

       <sup><sup>a</sup> Both Name and Location are strings, so they you'll need to retain the quotes in your cURL command.</sup>

       <sup><sup>b</sup> We've specified "Precision" and "Scale" for the latitude. That's 8 digits in the number; 6 of them to the *right* of the decimal.</sup>

       <sup><sup>c</sup> We've also specified "Precision" and "Scale for the longitude. Here we have 9 digits in the number; 6 of them to the *right* of the decimal.</sup>

       > üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è *Here is our example of the Bash cURL command we sent:*

        ```bash
        <copy>curl --location --request POST \
        'https://[Place your ORDS REST API here]' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data-binary '{
            "MUSEUM_NAME": "test1",
            "MUSEUM_LOCATION": "test1",
            "MUSEUM_LAT": 50.12345,
            "MUSEUM_LONG": 100.12345
            }'</copy>
        ```

9. Enter the cURL Command in your terminal (*your command may differ slightly*) to `POST` this entry to the associated table (located in our Autonomous database).

      ![The cURL command in the terminal](images/post-curl-command-in-terminal.png " ")

10. Then, using the URI from the first/previous **`GET`** request, enter it into your browser's address bar. You should now see the new record added to your list.  

    ![Reviewing the changes from your POST request](images/reviewing-the-post-request-changes.png " ")

       > ‚ùì The logic for this `POST` Resource Handler actually looks like this: 

       ![Reviewing the changes from your POST request](images/pl-sql-logic-in-resource-handler.png " ")

  > üí° *Refer to the `README` file retrieved in [Task 1](#Task1Obtaincodeforthisworkshop) for information on how to use the provided database scripts for setting up an Autonomous Database environment like this one.*

## Task 6: Review the remaining pages

1. With your application still open, click the "Purchase Day Passes" button:

    ![Purchase day passes focus](images/purchase-day-passes-focus.png " ")

2. You should see the **`orderform.html`** page load.

     > üòÄ Yet again, we have information provided to us by ORDS.
  
   The *Choose an option* dropdown has already been populated with product choices; this was done upon page load. The information comes from an autonomous database, handled exclusively Oracle REST APIs.
  
     ![Choosing a purchase option in the order form](images/choose-an-option-focus.png " ")

3. The *Description* and *Price per* fields change to reflect your product selection. Here is another example of Oracle REST APIs providing the requested product descriptions *and* pricing information.

   ![Description has been updated in order form](images/single-access-pass-option-description-updated.png " ")

   > üí° *A more performant alternative* to this approach might be to request all data from a single API. However, this example merely highlights how *multiple* Oracle REST APIs can be used on a single page.

4. Next, update the *Passes needed* field. Notice how the *Total Price* field update as well. When you're satisfied with your selections, click the "Complete my purchase" button:

   ![Total price updates on order form](images/total-price-updates-with-quantity.png " ")

5. The **`orderhistory.html`** page will load.

     > üß† *To keep this simple, we've omitted the payment gateway step.*

    A table with our previous orders will appear. Yet again, this information is provided via an Oracle REST API.

    ![Reviewing the changes from your POST request](images/table-with-previous-orders.png " ") 

6. To exit the Flask application, return to your terminal and press the `Control` + `C` keys.

7. Congratulations, you made it! You should now have a better understanding of:

   - This particular Flask application
   - The interactions between Oracle REST APIs and this application
   - How Oracle REST APIs can:
     - Accelerate application development, *and*
     - Reduce complexity

### You may now **proceed to the next Lab.**
