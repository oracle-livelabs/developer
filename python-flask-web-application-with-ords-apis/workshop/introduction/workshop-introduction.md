# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this Workshop we'll explore a Python application built with the Flask micro-framework. The application relies on Oracle Database REST **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterfaces (APIs) to serve, display, and store product and customer order information.

Since all necessary information is provided through Oracle REST APIs, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools are completely unnecessary.

By the end of this Workshop, you'll have a thorough understanding of how Oracle REST APIs can accelerate the development of your web applications. You will also be provided with sample Python code and Database scripts required to:

- Establish your own schema in an Oracle Autonomous Database
- Run this Flask application locally
- Extend already existing functionality

Estimated Workshop Time: 90 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:

- Explore an Oracle REST API-backed Flask application
- Explore and interact with Oracle REST APIs
- Review the application's routes and interactions with Oracle REST APIs
- Review elements of a Flask application's presentation layer

   > **NOTE:** This Workshop assumes you have limited experience with:
   - Web development in the Flask framework
   - HTML, CSS
   - JavaScript
   - Python
   - Python libraries
