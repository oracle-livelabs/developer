# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Welcome! In this Workshop we'll explore how a Python application built atop the Flask micro-framework uses Oracle Database REST **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterfaces (APIs) to serve, display, and store product information as well as customer orders for a fictitious online ticket ordering service located in Las Vegas, NV. This *Silver State*-based online storefront was designed to simplify the process of purchasing admissions to local venues and attractions.

Throughout these Labs you will observe how a user can access our website and purchase tickets to local attractions; ranging from museums to art installations.

You'll also learn how this Flask application can omit the tedious steps of creating, mapping, and modeling a database. Additionally, since all necessary information is provided through Oracle REST APIs, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools are completely unnecessary.

At the end of this Workshop, you should have a thorough understanding of how Oracle REST APIs can accelerate the development of Flask/Python web applications. You will also be provided with all Python code and Database scripts required to:

- Establish your own schema in an Oracle Autonomous Database
- Run this Flask application locally
- Extend already existing functionality

Throughout this Workshop we'll explore key concepts related to: 

- Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) APIs and characteristics
- Resource Templates, Handlers, and Methods 
- Popular Python libraries such as: [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/), [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/), [Json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html), [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Bootstrap - the popular HTML and CSS framework
- Select JavaScript functions
- OpenAPI Specifications and the Swagger Editor

Estimated Workshop Time: 90 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:

- Explore an Oracle REST API-backed Flask application
- Explore and interact with Oracle REST APIs
- Explore Oracle REST APIs in a Swagger Editor session
- Review a Flask application's routes and interactions with Oracle REST APIs
- Review elements of a Flask application's presentation layer

### Prerequisites

This Workshop assumes you have experience with Python development. This Workshop also assumes you have some experience with the Flask framework; including the proper commands for executing a Flask application.

While familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is helpful, knowledge in these areas is not required as we'll review these concepts in limited scope. 

Finally, this lab assumes you have the following developer environment: 

- Python 3.10 or later 
- A text editor (such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text)
- A Package Manager (i.e., Homebrew for Mac, *aka* pip)
- Select Python packages: 
  - Requests 
  - Folium
  - Json
  - Flask 
  - Virtual Environment (venv) *or* the Live Server extension for VS Code 

> ðŸ’¡ *If your development environment is not set-up accordingly, you may refer to the **Learn More** section for resources on how to set-up your environment.*

### You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
