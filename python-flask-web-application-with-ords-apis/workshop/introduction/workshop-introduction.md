# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this Workshop we'll explore a Python application built with the Flask micro-framework. We'll rely on Oracle Database REST **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterfaces (APIs) to serve, display, and store product and customer order information.

You'll also learn how this Flask application can omit the tedious steps of creating, mapping, and modeling a database. Additionally, since all necessary information is provided through Oracle REST APIs, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools are completely unnecessary.

By the end of this Workshop, you'll have a thorough understanding of how Oracle REST APIs can accelerate the development of your web applications. You will also be provided with the Python code and Database scripts required to:

- Establish your own schema in an Oracle Autonomous Database
- Run this Flask application locally
- Extend already existing functionality

Throughout this Workshop we'll explore key concepts related to:

- Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) APIs and characteristics
- Resource Templates, Handlers, and Methods
- Popular Python libraries such as: [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/), [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/), [Json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html), [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Bootstrap
- Select JavaScript functions
- OpenAPI Specifications

Estimated Workshop Time: 90 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:

- Explore an Oracle REST API-backed Flask application
- Explore and interact with Oracle REST APIs
- Review the application's routes and interactions with Oracle REST APIs
- Review elements of a Flask application's presentation layer

### Prerequisites

This Workshop assumes you have limited experience with Python development. This Workshop also assumes you have some experience with the Flask framework; including the proper commands for executing a Flask application.

Familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is helpful, although not required.

Finally, this lab assumes you have the following developer environment:

- Python 3.10 or later
- Visual Studio Code or similar editor
- A Package Manager (we'll refer to both Homebrew and PIP in this Workshop)
- Select Python packages:

  - Requests
  - Folium
  - Json
  - Flask
  - Virtual Environment (venv) *or* the Live Server extension for VS Code

> ðŸ’¡ *If your development environment is not set-up accordingly, you may refer to the **Learn More** section for resources on how to set-up your environment.*

### You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
