# Lab 2: Oracle REST API *deeper* dive

## Introduction

In the last Lab, you were first introduced to our sample Flask application and its primary functions. You also learned *superficially*, about some of the capabilities of Oracle REST APIs.

In this Lab, we'll continue our exploration of Oracle REST APIs using the browser-based OpenAPI Swagger editor.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

### Objectives

In this Lab, you will:

- Inspect and interact with the provided Oracle REST APIs
- Review available Paths and HTTPS Operations
- Review OpenAPI documentation

### Prerequisites

This Lab assumes you have:

- All previous Labs successfully completed

## Task 1: Navigate to the Swagger Editor

For this Lab, we'll rely on Swagger's Open Source Editor to review our ORDS Base URI and the available API *Paths* and *Operations*.

> üí° *You may skip straight to the **[Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)**, or follow along below.*

1. Navigate to the [Swagger home page](https://swagger.io/) and select the **Swagger Editor** link (located under the **Tools** dropdown).

   ![Navigating to the Swagger editor](images/select-swagger-editor.png " ")

2. Next, select **Live Demo** - a blank Swagger Editor session should load.

   ![Select live demo for Swagger editor](images/try-swagger-editor-live-demo-option.png " ")

3. If a new Editor session page does not appear, navigate to the **`File`** menu option and select **`Clear Editor`**. A new blank session should then appear.

    ![Clear previous Swagger editor session](images/clear-swagger-editor-optional.png " ")

4. Copy the following ORDS Base URI:

    ```html
    <copy>https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/open-api-catalog/flask/
    </copy>
    ```

5. Navigate to **`File`** then **`Import URL`**.

   ![Select Import URL in Swagger](images/import-url-into-editor.png " ")

6. Paste the URI into the input field, and click **`OK`**.

   ![Inputting the ORDS Base URI](images/enter-url-to-import.png " ")

7. Locate the Swagger documentation - available Paths and their Operations.

   Once loaded, Swagger documentation will appear on the left of your browser. Additionally, a list of the available ORDS Paths and their Operations is located on the right of your screen. These Paths and Operations are the heart and soul of our Flask application.

   ![Newly imported ORDS Base URI](images/newly-imported-ords-url.png " ")

## Task 2: Review the OpenAPI 3.0 definitions

1. Collapse the Swagger documentation tree:

    ![Collapsed Swagger tree](images/collapsed-swagger-tree.png " ")

2. Next, we'll briefly review the tree.

    1. **`openapi`** - this particular ORDS API adheres to the OpenAPI 3.0 specification for API documentation (as seen below). 

       ![The OpenAPI specification version](images/open-api-specification-version.png " ")
  
       > üß† *To learn more about OpenAPI specifications, you may refer to the resources provided in the "Learn More" section of this Lab.*

    2. **`info`** - here, you'll see the **`title`** and **`version`** of the ORDS *Base URI*.

       ![The Base URI for our ORDS API](images/open-api-title-version.png " ")

    3. **`servers`** - the actual Base URI for this ORDS API. All Paths and parameters will be added to this existing **U**niversal **R**esource **I**dentifier (URI), referred to as a **URL** here.

       ![The OpenAPI info](images/open-api-base-uri.png " ")

    4. **`paths`** - a list of our available *Paths*: 

       ![The OpenAPI info](images/open-api-paths.png " ")

       Expand the **`/orders/`** Path. We've designed this Path to accept both **`GET`** and **`POST`** requests.

       ![The OpenAPI info](images/orders-paths-detail.png " ")

       Review the **`GET`** Method; you should see all the properties.

       ![The OpenAPI info](images/orders-paths-get-details.png " ")

    5. **`components`** - otherwise considered *globally-defined* parameters that may be shared across the various Paths and their HTTPS Operations.

      ![The OpenAPI info](images/open-api-components.png " ")

## Task 3: Explore ORDS Templates and Handlers

1. **Locate the Paths**. Under the "default" section of the browser (on the right side of your browser window), you'll find the *Paths*.

    ![The paths overview page.](images/paths-overview-page.png " ")
  
      > üí° *You may refer to the "Learn More" section of this Lab to learn more about Resource Templates and their relationship to Resource Handlers.*

2. **Explore the Paths**. Here we'll review selected Paths and discuss their importance to the Flask application.

    1. **`GET` `/museums/`**

        1. Hover over this Path, and a dropdown arrow will appear. Click this to expand the window.

            > üí° *You'll follow similar actions for subsequent Paths.*

            ![Selecting the museums path.](images/path-main-screen-image.png " ")

        2. Click **Try it out**.

           ![Clicking try it out for the museums path.](images/get-path-for-folium-map.png " ")

        3. The **Execute** button will appear. Click it to issue a **`GET`** request.

           ![Executing the get request for the museums path.](images/get-path-for-folium-execute-request.png " ")

        4. Scroll down to the **Response Body** of the **`GET`** request.

          ![The get response for the folium map](images/get-path-for-folium-response.png " ")

          > ‚ùì *What does this payload look like it could be used for?* If you guessed a map rendering, then you'd be correct! We use this information to populate the Folium map on our Flask application's main page (aka **`index.html`**).

    2. **`GET` `/products/descriptions/{product_id}`**

          1. Expand the Path's window and click **Try it out**. Notice the input field for an Implicit Parameter (we'll be updating this shortly).

              ![The product description path overview](images/get-path-product-info.png " ")

          2. Your Flask application has three different products, each with its own Product ID (i.e., **`product_id`**). To test this Path, we'll input the number **`1`** and click **`Execute`**.

              ![Executing the get request for product descriptions](images/get-path-product-info-execute.png " ")

          3. Notice how the Request URL (the first red box in the image below) has changed slightly to include the **`product_id`**. Next, we'll review the Server response.

             - You'll see this **`product_description`** (the second red box in the image below) appear on the ordering/purchasing page of our Flask application. A separate API call is executed to display a product description as the user selects a product.

               ![Response for product description get request](images/get-path-product-info-response.png " ")

             - A similar Path has been created for **`GET` `/products/pricing/{product_id}`**. But instead of a product description, the unit price for a product is returned.

               ![The OpenAPI info](images/quick-view-pricing-path.png " ")

    3. **`POST` `/orders/`**

        Next, we'll review the **`/orders/`** Path. Recall this Path has both a **`GET`** and a **`POST`** request. We'll review the **`POST`** request for this example.

        1. Expand the window and click **Try it out**. Pause and review the Example Value - Schema section. You'll notice how the **`POST`** request is structured as a JSON object.

            ![Orders post path overview.](images/post-purchase-history.png " ")

        2. After clicking **Try it out**, the Request body will expand, and you'll see a placeholder array.

           ![Placeholder array in order post request.](images/post-purchase-history-placeholder-array.png " ")

        3. Alter the values slightly. Choose:

           - 1, 2 or 3 for **`PRODUCT_ID`** value
           - between 1-100 for **`QUANTITY`** value
           - between 1.00-500.00 for **`TOTAL_PRICE`** value

           > üìù Choose an *easily recognizable* **`TOTAL_PRICE`*** value. 

        4. Once you are satisfied, click **`Execute`**.

           ![Clicking Execute to issue POST request.](images/clicking-execute-on-orders-post.png " ")

        5. Scroll down to the Response body. You should see a **`201`** Server Response code, which indicates that your **`POST`** was successful!

            ![Scrolling down to review the Response Body for new POST](images/scrolling-down-to-review-new-post.png " ")

            > üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è The action we just performed mirrors what customers would do should they complete a transaction in our sample Flask application.

        6. Let's find your **`POST`** by performing a **`GET`** request on **`/orders/`**. Expand the **`GET /orders/`** window.

           ![Expanding the Get /orders/ window.](images/expanding-the-get-orders-window.png " ")

        7. Click **Try it out** followed by **Execute**.

           ![Try it out action.](images/expanding-the-get-orders-try-it-out.png " ")
          <sub>*Clicking **Try it out** followed by **Execute**.*</sub>

           ![Execute get request action.](images/executing-get-request-on-orders.png " ")

        8. Once the request completes, scroll down to the Response Body and locate your new entry.

           ![Locating your new POST in the GET Response Body.](images/locating-newest-post-in-get-orders-response-body.png " ")

        9. You can also download a **`JSON`** file and review it directly in your editor!

           ![Downloading the JSON from Swagger](images/downloading-json-from-swagger.png " ")
          <sub>*Reviewing a `JSON` document in VS Code.*</sub>

           ![Reviewing the JSON file in VS Code.](images/reviewing-json-in-vs-code.png " ")

3. In the next Lab, you'll review the application routing, functions, and how they interact with these same Oracle REST APIs.  

### You may now **proceed to the next Lab.**
