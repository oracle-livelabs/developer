# Lab 3: Review the Python and Oracle REST API relationship

## Introduction

In the previous Lab, you explored Oracle REST APIs in a Swagger Editor session.

Next, we'll add Oracle REST APIs to our Flask application and briefly discuss the application's routes and their functions.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

### Objectives

In this Lab, you will:

* Add Oracle REST APIs to a Flask application
* Review the basic operations of the application

### Prerequisites

This Lab assumes you have:

* Successfully completed all previous Labs

## Task 1: Locate and open the Python file for the Flask application

1. Locate your copy of the **`flask-ords-lab`** folder and open the **`lab_3_app.py`** file in Visual Studio Code.

   ![Open the lab_3_app.py file folder in VS Code.](images/opening-lab-3-app-py-file.png " ")

   > üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è The examples in this Lab will rely on Visual Studio Code for code editing.

## Task 2: Review the Python application and functions

1. Note the libraries included in this application.

     ![Imported libraries for Python application](images/imported-libraries-for-application.png " ")

    We'll rely on:

      * **`Folium`**
      * **`Flask`**
      * **`jsonify`**
      * **`requests`**
      * **`json`**

2. You'll notice we have created an instance of the **`Flask`** class: **`app = Flask(__name__)`**.

   The argument **`(__name__)`** is sufficient for such a small-scale application.

   ![Reviewing the flask app name](images/first-line-flask-app-name.png)

## Task 3: Review the Folium map

1. Next, you'll see the `Folium` section of the application.

   ![Reviewing Folium content in the application](images/reviewing-folium-content-in-app.png)
   <sup>*We've included starting coordinates (approximately the downtown Las Vegas, NV area), set minimum and maximum zoom properties, and set the visual presentation option (i.e., "Stamen Terrain").*</sup>

   In this section we:

    * set the initial base Folium map = `m`
    * include a tooltip (which you'll see later when we load the application)
    * use the "Requests" library along with our Oracle REST APIs to **`GET`** JSON from our Autonomous Database
  
       > ‚ùì Anything missing?

       ![Missing ORDS endpoint for Folium map](images/missing-ords-uri-for-folium.png " ")

2. Replace **`[ORDS URI HERE]`** with the following:

    ```html
    <copy>https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/museums/
    </copy>
    ```  

   <details>
     <summary>**CLICK HERE TO REVEAL CODE BLOCK**</summary>

     ```python
     <copy>m = folium.Map(location=[36.085645468598855, -115.08441257156686], zoom_start=10, min_zoom=10, tiles="Stamen Terrain")

     tooltip = "Click me!"

     response = requests.get("https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/museums/").json()

     for museums in response['items']:
       try: 
         museum_id = museums['museum_id']
         museum_lat = museums['museum_lat']
         museum_long = museums['museum_long']
         museum_name = museums['museum_name']

     except: 
         continue

     folium.Marker(
         location=[museum_lat, museum_long],
         popup=folium.Popup("<i>{}</i>".format(museum_name), max_width=450), icon=folium.Icon(color="lightred", icon="info-sign"),
         tooltip=tooltip
         ).add_to(m)

     lvmap = m._repr_html_()</copy>
     ```

   </details>

3. With the endpoint restored, we can iterate on our table data to gather the necessary information for populating our Folium map.

    ![Iterating over the map data.](images/iterating-over-the-museum-data.png " ")
  
4. We'll then create individual markers for the museum locations we retrieved from our database.

   Here, we'll pass the latitude and longitude coordinates and informational pop-ups for all the locations.

   ![Creating markers for Folium.](images/creating-markers-for-folium-map.png " ")
   <sup>*Notice how we include **`museum_name`** as HTML, icon color, and type, as well as a **`tooltip`.***</sup>

   > üí° The tooltip generates a helpful bubble that reads *Click me!* when hovered over.

5. Finally, you'll see the line **`lvmap = m._repr_html_()`**:

   ![Temporarily saving the Folium map.](images/saving-folium-map-as-lvmap.png " ")
   <sup>*We include this to temporarily save our map as an HTML iframe (this consists of all necessary HTML and JavaScript properties).*</sup>

## Task 4: Review the Flask application routes

> üß† Application routes are triggered when actions are performed in the application. They can trigger a function, a new HTML page may load, or it may redirect the user to another page.
  
1. **`@app.route('/')`**

    ![The Index route](images/app-route-index.png " ")

    This route contains the **`index()`** function. When a user navigates to the home page, they'll be presented with the **`index.html`** page. We also include,**`lvmap`**, the Folium map.

2. **`@app.route('/get_price')`**

    ![The Get Price route](images/app-route-get-price.png " ")

    The function of the **`getPrice()`** route appends the letter **`a`** to an ORDS endpoint. To see this in action, take this ORDS URL and place it into your browser's address bar.

      ```html
      <copy>https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/products/pricing/</copy>
      ```

    > ‚ùì Press **`Enter`** on your keyboard, what do you see?

      ![404 pricing not found error.](images/pricing-not-found-404-error.png " ")

      This function needs a specific **`product_id`**. Recall from the previous Lab, this Path: **`/products/pricing/{product_id}`**.

     For this endpoint to work, include a 1, 2, or 3 after that final trailing backslash. Then press `Enter`:

     ![Updated get request with product ID included.](images/pricing-info-with-product-id-included.png " ")

     At this stage, a user will have triggered the retrieval of product prices from a product table. This information is used as one of the fields in a drop-down menu (found on the **`orderform.html`** page).
  
     Before moving on, make sure your **`get_price`** function has the correct Path:

      ```html
      <copy>https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/products/pricing/</copy>
      ```

      ![The Get Price function with updated ORDS URL](images/get-price-function-with-updated-ords-url.png " ")

      <details>
        <summary>**CLICK HERE TO REVEAL CODE BLOCK**</summary>

      ```python
      <copy>@app.route('/get_price')
      def getPrice():
      a = request.args.get('a')
      url = "https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/products/pricing/"+a
      
      response = requests.get(url)
      
      for ids in response.json()['items']:
        
          idList = dict()
          try:
              product_price = ids['product_price']
              /      
          except:
              pass
              
      return jsonify(product_price)</copy>
      ```

      </details>
  
3. **`@app.route('/get_description')`**
  
   This function requests product description information using a similar syntax. We then **`return jsonify(product_description)`**, which takes the response (production description information) and converts it as we saw in the previous function.

    ![The Get Description route](images/app-route-get-description.png " ")
  
     Place this endpoint in the correct location:  

      ```html
      <copy>https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/products/descriptions/</copy>
      ```

      It should resemble this:

      ![Get Description route with updated ORDS endpoint](images/get-description-with-updated-ords-endpoint.png " ")

    <details>
      <summary>**CLICK HERE TO REVEAL CODE BLOCK**</summary>
  
      ```python
      <copy>@app.route('/get_description')
      def getDescription():
      a = request.args.get('a')
      url = "https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/products/descriptions/"+a
      response = requests.get(url)
      
      for ids in response.json()['items']:
        
          idList = dict()
          try:
              product_description = ids['product_description']
          
          except:
              pass
              
      return jsonify(product_description)</copy>
      ```

    </details>

4. **`@app.route('/orderform')`**
   We'll need to include another URI for this **`GET`** request to work.

    ![The Order Form route](images/app-route-order-form.png " ")
  
     Place this in the correct location:

      ```html
      <copy>https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/products/</copy>
      ```

     ![The newly added get products ORDS endpoint.](images/get-products-ords-endpoint.png)

     Our application performs a more typical **`GET`** request using a separate ORDS endpoint. Here we return a list of products and redirect the user to an **`orderform.html`** page.

      <details>
      <summary>**CLICK HERE TO REVEAL CODE BLOCK**</summary>
          ```python
          <copy>@app.route('/orderform')
          def orderMake():
            def getProducts():
            response = requests.get("https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/products/")

            list_of_products = []
            
                for products in response.json()['items']:
                        
                  productList = dict()
                  try: 
                    product_id = products['product_id']
                    product_name = products['product_name'] 
                    
                    productList['product_id'] = product_id
                    productList['product_name'] = product_name
                          
                    list_of_products.append(productList)
                            
                  except:
                    pass
                    
                return list_of_products
                
            list_of_products = getProducts()
            return render_template('orderform.html',list_of_products_from_request=list_of_products)</copy>
            ```

   </details>

5. **`@app.route('/orderhistory')`**

    Performing a **`GET`** request to this endpoint will return all *previously* purchased items; displayed in table format.

    ![The order history route](images/app-route-order-history.png " ")

    Place this in the correct location:

     ```html
     <copy>https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1. oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/orders/</copy>
     ```

   ![The order history route](images/completed-get-orders-ords-endpoint.png " ")

      <details>
        <summary>**CLICK HERE TO REVEAL CODE BLOCK**</summary>
          ```python
          <copy>@app.route('/orderhistory')
          def orderHistory():
              def getOrders():
                  response = requests.get("https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/orders/")
                  list_of_orders = []
                  
                  for orders in response.json()['items']:
                    
                      ordersList = dict()
                      try:
                        
                          order_id = orders['order_id']
                          product_name = orders['product_name']
                          product_description = orders['product_description']
                          quantity = orders['quantity']
                          total_price = orders['total_price']
                          
                          ordersList['order_id'] = order_id
                          ordersList['product_name'] = product_name
                          ordersList['product_description'] = product_description 
                          ordersList['quantity'] = quantity
                          ordersList['total_price'] = total_price
                          
                          list_of_orders.append(ordersList)
                          
                      except:
                          pass
                          
                  return list_of_orders
                  /
              list_of_orders = getOrders()
              return render_template('orderhistory.html', list_of_orders_from_request=list_of_orders)</copy>
            ```

    </details>

   > üß† *You've seen this app route in action in Lab 1 of this Workshop! Remember the **`orderform.html`** page?*

6. **`@app.route(/result', methods = ['POST', 'GET'])`**

    ![The order history post requests result route.](images/app-route-result.png " ")

    Here we have the same ORDS endpoint as in the **`orderhistory`** app route. But instead of a **`GET`**, this is a **`POST`** request. Recall in Lab 1, when a user clicks `Complete my Purchase`,

      ![Completing the purchase focused-view.](images/complete-my-purchase-focus-view.png " ")

     And this route expects a **`POST`** request originating from the Flask application. Once this request posts successfully, the user is redirected to the **`orderhistory.html`** page (as you saw in the previous step). 

    > üß† *This function also performs actions such as establishing the **`{Key: Value}`** pairs of the incoming data and the JSON payload headers.*

    Update the function with the following ORDS URL:

    ```html
    <copy>https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/orders/</copy>
    ```
  
    Your final route should look like this:

    ![Completed orders post ORDS endpoint.](images/completed-orders-post-ords-endpoint.png " ")

    <details>
      <summary>**CLICK HERE TO REVEAL CODE BLOCK**</summary>
      ```python
      <copy>@app.route('/result', methods = ['POST', 'GET'])
      def result():
        url = "https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/orders/"
        if request.method == 'POST':
              product_id = request.form.get('product_id')
              quantity = request.form.get('quantity')
              total = request.form.get('total_price')

              json_data = { "PRODUCT_ID": product_id, "QUANTITY": quantity,"TOTAL_PRICE": total}
              
              headers = {'Content-type':'application/json', 'Accept':'application/json'}
              response = requests.post(url, json=json_data, headers=headers)
              
              return redirect('orderhistory')</copy>
      ```
    </details>

7. At this stage, you should have updated all ORDS endpoints. Next, we'll briefly review the included HTML and CSS in this Flask application.
