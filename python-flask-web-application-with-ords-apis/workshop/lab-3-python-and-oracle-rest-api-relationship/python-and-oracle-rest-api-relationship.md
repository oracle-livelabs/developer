# Lab 3: Review the Python and Oracle REST API relationship

## Introduction

In the last Lab, you explored Oracle REST APIs in a Swagger Editor session. By now, you should better understand what these Oracle REST APIs are capable of. 

Next, we'll add Oracle REST APIs to our Flask application's Python file. And briefly discuss the Flask application's routes and their functions.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this Lab, you will:
* Add Oracle REST APIs to our Flask application
* Review the provided Python application 

### Prerequisites
This Lab assumes you have:
* All previous labs successfully completed

## Task 1: Locate and open the Python file for the Flask application

1. Locate your copy of the **`flask-ords-lab`** folder and open the **`lab_3_app.py`** file in your editor.

   ![Open the lab_3_app.py file folder in VS Code.](images/opening-lab-3-app-py-file.png " ")

   > üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è The examples in this Lab will use Visual Studio Code.

## Task 2: Review the Python application and functions

1. Note the libraries included in this application. 

     ![Imported libraries for Python application](images/imported-libraries-for-application.png " ")

    You may have used these before. We'll rely upon:
      * **`Folium`**
      * **`Flask`**
      * **`jsonify`**
      * **`requests`**
      * **`json`**

2. **Python application overview**. Beginning with the first line in our code, you'll see we have created an instance of the **`Flask`** class: **`app = Flask(__name__)`**.

  Here the argument **`(__name__)`** is sufficient for such a small-scale application. 

    ![Reviewing the flask app name](images/first-line-flask-app-name.png)

## Task 3: Review the Folium map 

1. Here, you'll see the Folium section of the application. 

   ![Reviewing Folium content in the application](images/reviewing-folium-content-in-app.png)
   <sup>*We've included starting coordinates (approximately the downtown Las Vegas, NV area), set minimum and maximum zoom properties, and set the visual presentation option (i.e., "Stamen Terrain").*</sup>

    * We set the initial base Folium map = `m`      

    * We include a tooltip (which you'll see later when we load the application).
    * We use the "Requests" library along with our Oracle REST APIs to **`GET`** JSON from our Autonomous Database.
   
       > ‚ùì *But do you notice anything missing?*

       ![Missing ORDS endpoint for Folium map](images/missing-ords-uri-for-folium.png " ")

2. You'd be correct if you guessed an Oracle REST endpoint. Replace **`ORDS URI HERE`** with the following: 

    ```
    <copy>https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/museums/
    </copy>
    ```  

   <details>
     <summary>*Reveal code block*</summary>
     ```python
     <copy>m = folium.Map(location=[36.085645468598855, -115.08441257156686], zoom_start=10, min_zoom=10, tiles="Stamen Terrain")

     tooltip = "Click me!"

     response = requests.get("https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/museums/").json()

     for museums in response['items']:
       try: 
         museum_id = museums['museum_id']
         museum_lat = museums['museum_lat']     
         museum_long = museums['museum_long']
         museum_name = museums['museum_name']

     except: 
         continue

     folium.Marker(
         location=[museum_lat, museum_long],
         popup=folium.Popup("<i>{}</i>".format(museum_name), max_width=450), icon=folium.Icon(color="lightred", icon="info-sign"),
         tooltip=tooltip
         ).add_to(m)

     lvmap = m._repr_html_()</copy>
     ```
   </details>

3. *Now* that we've restored the endpoint, we can iterate on our table data to gather the necessary information for populating our Folium map.

    ![Iterating over the map data.](images/iterating-over-the-museum-data.png " ")
  
4. We'll then create individual markers for the museum locations we retrieved from our database:

    * Here, we'll pass the latitude and longitude coordinates and informational pop-ups for all the locations.
          
       ![Creating markers for Folium.](images/creating-markers-for-folium-map.png " ")
       <sup>*Notice how we include **`museum_name`** as HTML, icon color, and type, as well as a **`tooltip`.***</sup>

       > üí° The tooltip generates a helpful bubble that reads *Click me!*when hovered over.

5. Finally, you'll see the line **`lvmap = m._repr_html_()`**:

   ![Temporarily saving the Folium map.](images/saving-folium-map-as-lvmap.png " ")
      
   <sup>*We include this to temporarily save our map as an HTML iframe (this consists of all necessary HTML and JavaScript properties), which we'll later use as an argument in our application's index page (in Flask).*</sup> 

## Task 4: Review the Flask application routes

> üß† *A Routes Primer*: Application routes (aka **`app.route()`**) are triggered when actions are performed in the application. The results of a function may be passed back to the user, a new HTML page may load, or it may redirect the user to a new page. 
  
1. **`@app.route('/')`**
        
    ![The Index route](images/app-route-index.png " ")

    This route contains the **`index()`** function. When a user navigates to the home page, they'll be presented with the **`index.html`** page. We are also including our newly constructed Folium map, **`lvmap`**, as an argument. 

2. **`@app.route('/get_price')`**

    ![The Get Price route](images/app-route-get-price.png " ")

    The function of the **`getPrice()`** route appends **`a`** to an ORDS endpoint. To see this in action, take this ORDS URL and place it into your browser's address bar. 
    
      ```
      <copy>https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/products/pricing/</copy>
      ```
     
     > ‚ùì *Click **Enter**, what do you see?*

     You might see something like this:
        
     ![404 pricing not found error.](images/pricing-not-found-404-error.png " ")

     That's because our function needs a specific **`product_id`**. Remember from the last Lab, this Path: **`/products/pricing/{product_id}`**. 
    
    Include a 1, 2, or 3 after that final trailing backslash, and hit enter. *Like this*: 
 
    ![Updated get request with product ID included.](images/pricing-info-with-product-id-included.png " ")

    Now you should have a better idea of how this and other functions will work "under the covers." At this stage, a user will have triggered the retrieval of product prices from a product table. This information is used as one of the fields in a drop-down menu (found on the **`orderform.html`** page). 
    
    Make sure your **`get_price`** function has the correct Path: 
      ```
      <copy>https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/products/pricing/</copy>
      ``` 

      It should resemble this: 

      ![The Get Price function with updated ORDS URL](images/get-price-function-with-updated-ords-url.png " ")

    <details>
      <summary>*Reveal code block*</summary>
      ```python
      <copy>@app.route('/get_price')
      def getPrice():
      a = request.args.get('a')
      url = "https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/products/pricing/"+a

      response = requests.get(url)

      for ids in response.json()['items']:
    
          idList = dict()
          try:
              product_price = ids['product_price']       

          except:
              pass
  
      return jsonify(product_price)</copy>
      ```
   </details>
    
3. **`@app.route('/get_description')`**
  
  Much like the **`get_price`** app route, this function requests product description information from our database using a similar syntax. We then **`return jsonify(product_description)`**, which takes the response and converts it as we did in the previous function.

    ![The Get Description route](images/app-route-get-description.png " ")
  
    Take place this in the correct location, so our function works:  
      ```
      <copy>https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/products/descriptions/</copy>
      ```
    It should resemble this: 

    ![Get Description route with updated ORDS endpoint](images/get-description-with-updated-ords-endpoint.png " ")

  <details>
    <summary>*Reveal code block*</summary>
    ```python
    <copy>@app.route('/get_description')
    def getDescription():
    a = request.args.get('a')
    url = "https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/products/descriptions/"+a

    response = requests.get(url)

    for ids in response.json()['items']:
        
        idList = dict()
        try:
            product_description = ids['product_description']       

        except:
            pass

    return jsonify(product_description)</copy>
    ```
  </details>

4. **`@app.route('/orderform')`**

  You should see something like this:

    ![The Order Form route](images/app-route-order-form.png " ")

  We'll need to include another URI for our **`GET`** request to work. Place this in the correct location:
    ```
    <copy>https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/products/</copy>
    ``` 

    ![The newly added get products ORDS endpoint.](images/get-products-ords-endpoint.png)
    
  Our application performs a more typical **`GET`** request using a separate ORDS endpoint. Here we return a list of products and redirect the user to an **`orderform.html`** page. 
 
  <details>
    <summary>*Reveal code block*</summary>
    ```python
    <copy>@app.route('/orderform') 
    def orderMake():
      def getProducts():    
      response = requests.get("https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/products/")
      
      list_of_products = []

          for products in response.json()['items']:
                    
            productList = dict()
            try: 
              product_id = products['product_id']
              product_name = products['product_name'] 
              
              productList['product_id'] = product_id
              productList['product_name'] = product_name
                        
              list_of_products.append(productList)
                        
            except:
              pass

          return list_of_products

            list_of_products = getProducts()
      return render_template('orderform.html', list_of_products_from_request=list_of_products)</copy>
      ```
  </details>

5. **`@app.route('/orderhistory')`**

  ![The order history route](images/app-route-order-history.png " ")

  Performing a **`GET`** request to this endpoint will return all *previously* purchased items; displayed in 
  table format.

  Place this in the correct location:
    ```
    <copy>https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/orders/</copy>
    ```

      ![The order history route](images/completed-get-orders-ords-endpoint.png " ")

  <details>
    <summary>*Reveal code block*</summary>
    ```python
    <copy>@app.route('/orderhistory')
    def orderHistory():
        def getOrders():
            response = requests.get("https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/orders/")
            list_of_orders = []

            for orders in response.json()['items']:

                ordersList = dict()
                try:

                    order_id = orders['order_id']
                    product_name = orders['product_name']
                    product_description = orders['product_description']
                    quantity = orders['quantity']
                    total_price = orders['total_price']

                    ordersList['order_id'] = order_id
                    ordersList['product_name'] = product_name
                    ordersList['product_description'] = product_description 
                    ordersList['quantity'] = quantity
                    ordersList['total_price'] = total_price

                    list_of_orders.append(ordersList)

                except:
                    pass

            return list_of_orders 
    
        list_of_orders = getOrders()
        return render_template('orderhistory.html', list_of_orders_from_request=list_of_orders)</copy>
      ```
  </details>
    
    > üß† *You've seen this app route in action in Lab 1 of this Workshop! Remember the **`orderform.html`** page?*

6. **`@app.route(/result', methods = ['POST', 'GET'])`**

    ![The order history post requests result route.](images/app-route-result.png " ")

    Here we have the same ORDS endpoint as in the **`orderhistory`** app route. But instead of a **`GET`**, we are working with a **`POST`** request. If you remember back to Lab 1, a user will click:

      ![Completing the purchase focused-view.](images/complete-my-purchase-focus-view.png " ")

    And this route expects a **`POST`** request originating from the Flask application. Once this request posts successfully, the user is redirected to the **`orderhistory.html`** page (as you saw in the previous step). 
    
    > üß† *This function also performs actions such as establishing the **`{Key: Value}`** pairs of the incoming data and the JSON payload headers.*

    Update the function with the following ORDS URL: 
    ```
    <copy>https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/orders/</copy>
    ```
    
    Your final route should look like this: 

    ![Completed orders post ORDS endpoint.](images/completed-orders-post-ords-endpoint.png " ")

    <details>
      <summary>*Reveal code block*</summary>
      ```python
      <copy>@app.route('/result', methods = ['POST', 'GET'])    
      def result():
        url = "https://yfuxkbz2ls7taze-ordshandsonlabs.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/python/flask/orders/"
        if request.method == 'POST':
              product_id = request.form.get('product_id')
              quantity = request.form.get('quantity')
              total = request.form.get('total_price')
              
              json_data = { "PRODUCT_ID": product_id, "QUANTITY": quantity, "TOTAL_PRICE": total}

              headers = {'Content-type':'application/json', 'Accept':'application/json'}
              response = requests.post(url, json=json_data, headers=headers)
          
              return redirect('orderhistory')</copy>
      ```
    </details>

7. At this stage, you should have updated all ORDS endpoints. All application routes and their underlying functions should work correctly. Next, we'll briefly review the included HTML and CSS in this Flask application. Zut Alors!
