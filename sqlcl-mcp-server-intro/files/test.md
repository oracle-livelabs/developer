1. Navigate to the following URI: https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/json-dummy-data/5MB.json

2. Use the data found at that location as the basis for a table in my schema

3. Create a table in my schema using the repeating keys found in that json object. 

<!-- need to add in a step to convert the json to csv -->
<!-- Then, add a step to instruct to use the sclcl load command to batch data to table -->

4. Populate the table with the corresponding values.

5. Tell me when you have successfully completed this task. 

6. Provide me with details about this process

7. Also add to my downloads folder two sql files. One for recreating this table, and another for populating it with. Both should be in Oracle SQL, ending in a .sql file extension.
