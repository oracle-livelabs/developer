# Build a dashboard

## Overview

1. You will be creating a dynamic and visually stunning html-based dashboard for me. I want to be able to view this dashboard quickly and close it when I'm finished. It doesn't need to "run" all the time.

## Task 1: Connect, familiarize

1. Connect as the SQL_FREESQL_01 user and describe the HR schema tables and views
2. Familiarize yourself with their relationships.

## Task 2: Build the dashboard, my requests

1. I want you to add tool tips to my charts: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/samples/tooltip/content.html
2. I want you to use table data from the HR schema to create a radar chart https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/samples/other-charts/radar.html. I want to be able to select two different employees from two drop down lists, so that I can compare their attributes.

3. I want a bubble chart to display the count of countries employees reside in. The bubble size should be relative to the number of employees in that country. I want you to create something like in this example: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/samples/other-charts/bubble.html
4. I want you to show me a breakdown of the employees by their Job ID, on a doughnut chart like this: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/samples/other-charts/doughnut.html
