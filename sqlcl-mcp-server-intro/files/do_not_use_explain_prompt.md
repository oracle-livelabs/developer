# Optimize my PL/SQL

1. Connect as the SQL_FREESQL_01 user
2. Create three tables for me; please recommend the names, attributes, constraints, and indexes to me.
3. Once I approve, populate these tables with 100 rows each of sample data

## Create a PLSQL procedure

1. Propose an extremely non-performant PL/SQL procedure to use on these tables.
2. Explain what that PLSQL procedure does, and why it is not performant. 
3. Povide me instructions on how I should use it.
4. Once I approve, create the procedure for me. 

## Executing the procedure

1. Allow me to execute the procedure
2. Provide me execution and performance statistics and metrics on the PL/SQL Procedure
3. Show me the Explain Plan for this PLSQL Procedure 

## Make recommendations

1. Provid me with recommendation on how I can optimize this PLSQL procedure.
2. Once I approve, refactor the PLSQL procedure so it his highly performant
3. Allow me to execute the new PLSQL procedure 
4. Provide me execution and performance statistics and metrics on the PL/SQL Procedure
3. Show me the Explain Plan for this PLSQL Procedure 

## Visualize the difference

1. Use the pre-optimzation and post-optimization results of the PLSQL procedure to create an html-based visualization of the performance difference among the two
2. The html visualization should have a detailed list of the changes that were made to improve the performance
