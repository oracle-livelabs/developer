# Single Web Page Application example

## Overview

1. You will create a sample single page React application using available information in the SQL_FREESQL_01 schema.
2. You have access to view the table data in the CO schema. The sample application will use data from these CO tables. 
3. You will make provisions for dynamically fetching data from the database, but the version 1 of this application will use hard-coded values from the CO table data.
4. You will follow the instructions in the following steps

## CO schema exploration

1. Connect as the SQL_FREESQL_01 user and explore the CO tables
2. Provide me with a summary of insights on the CO tables
3. Recommend to me some potential statistics/metrics in this CO schema that would be interesting for the single page web application. 
4. Allow me to choose one of these statistics/metrics to use for the single page web application.

## Creating the web application

1. Create a project directory before scaffolding a project.
2. Once the directory is created, scaffold the single page React application. 
3. Using what you learned about the CO schema, and the selection I made in the CO schema exploration section, reconnect as the SQL_FREESQL_01 user and query the values you need to populate the React application.
4. The React application should include a graph or chart to visualize the data. And there should be a table underneath, or next to the visualization that shows the values. 
5. Share with me what you intend to display on the React page before altering the app source files.

## Provide some helpful inight 
1. Once complete, provide me with a list of next steps, or recommended actions for making this more dynamic.
2. Answer the following questions: 
  - What options do I have for establishing an Oracle database connection so my app can update in real time? 
  - What options do I have if a user wants to update one of these underlying tables? 
  - What other functions do you recommend this app should have? 
  - What other Oracle database technologies could I use in/with this React application? 

## Launch the web application

1. Launch the web application and review it for accuracy and expected outcome
2. If the data and visualization are not visible on screen, please debug as needed.
