- Python micro-service with the new MongoAPI capability


**Estimated Workshop Time: 120 minutes.**

## Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create development environment on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
* Deploy a document store with one collection on Oracle Autonomous Database for JSON
* Develop a simple Python web service to manage JSON documents via REST calls
* Use APEX to visualize document store in a very fast way
* Use multi-cloud support to your Python web service to support MongoDB
* Compare and understand the differences between Oracle SODA with MongoDB API and Oracle MongoAPI capability
* Use MongoAPI capability for micro-service Python application


## Prerequisites

* An Oracle Free Tier, Always Free, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account - You can check Getting Started section for more information.

We are providing a basic reference to create a Mongo DB account, we are not pretending to be MongoDB experts or provide MongoDB best practices. We are using MongoDB account as user for the workshop purpose not experts level on the matter. If you need support on this process, contact your MongoDB support contact.

Here you have a [Prerequisites document](https://objectstorage.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com/p/8mPUcFqASM0awq5qKFU9mD6occf83Z5vxeOrWC38CEU2nC-15wusaIY6aCehDVW6/n/fruktknlrefu/b/workshop-ajson-mongodb/o/MongoDB%20Developers%20Full%20Python%20App%20Development%20with%20Autonomous%20JSON%20-%20Prerequisites.pdf) where you can find support to crete the Oracle Cloud account and MongoDB account.

*At this point, you are ready to start learning! Please proceed.*
