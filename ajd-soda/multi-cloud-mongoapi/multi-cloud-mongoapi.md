# Python micro-service with Oracle Autonomous and MongoDB

## Introduction

Oracle Autonomous JSON Database (AJD) is a new service in Autonomous Database family for JSON-centric development. Autonomous JSON Database is built for developers who are looking for an easy to use, cost-effective JSON database with native Document API support. Autonomous JSON Database provides all the core capabilities of a document store along with high performance, simple elasticity, full ACID support and complete SQL functionality.

Learn why customers choose Oracle Autonomous JSON Database over MongoDB Atlas. Autonomous JSON Database provides all the core capabilities of MongoDB along with high performance, simple elasticity, full ACID support and complete SQL functionality.

**Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes**.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Use multi-cloud support to your Python web service to support MongoDB
* Compare Oracle SODA with MongoDB API

### Prerequisites

* Lab 1 and 2 from this content completed
* MongoDB Cloud account (or Google account)
* Deploy Atlas document store on MongoDB Cloud before the workshop (run Lab 3 Task 1)

We are providing a basic reference to create a Mongo DB account, we are not pretending to be MongoDB experts or provide MongoDB best practices. We are using MongoDB account as user for the workshop purpose not experts level on the matter. If you need support on this process, contact your MongoDB support contact.

Here you have a [Prerequisites document](https://objectstorage.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com/p/8mPUcFqASM0awq5qKFU9mD6occf83Z5vxeOrWC38CEU2nC-15wusaIY6aCehDVW6/n/fruktknlrefu/b/workshop-ajson-mongodb/o/MongoDB%20Developers%20Full%20Python%20App%20Development%20with%20Autonomous%20JSON%20-%20Prerequisites.pdf) where you can find support to crete the Oracle Cloud account and MongoDB account.


## Task 1: Deploy Atlas document store on MongoDB Cloud

One of the objectives of this workshop is to show the integration of Oracle Autonomous JSON Database with existing document stores like MongoDB. This is why you need an existing MongoDB database, and if you don't have one, you can provision it quickly on MondoDB Cloud.

1. **Access MongoDB Cloud** at [https://cloud.mongodb.com](https://cloud.mongodb.com), and **Create an account.** You can login using your Google account.
    
    ![MongoDB Sign In](./images/task1/mongodb-sign-in.png)

2. Click **Build a Database**. Select the **Free option**, choose a Cloud Provider and Region. Create the **New Cluster** using the default settings. Name it **Cluster0**.

    - Cluster Name:
    ```
    <copy>Cluster0</copy>
    ```

    ![MongoDB Free Option](./images/task1/mongodb-free-option.png)
    ![MongoDB CloudProvider](./images/task1/mongodb-cloud-provider.png)
    
    > Note: If you get a **Quick Start wizard**, please fill out the following information: Add Public IP address (Step 4 of this Task) and Add Database User (Step 5 of this Task). Otherwise go to the next step number 3.

    ![MongoDB Quick Start](./images/task1/mongodb-quick-start.png)

3. Once your **Cluster** is up and running, on the **overview page**, click **Connect**.

    ![MongoDB Connect](./images/task1/mongodb-connect.png)

4. Click **Add a Different IP Address**, and use the **Public IP address** of your **DEVM** Compute Node. To add more or change this IP address, go to Security > Network Access on the left side menu.

    ![MongoDB Network](./images/task1/mongodb-network.png)

    ![MongoDB Network IP Address](./images/task1/mongodb-network-ip-address.png)

5. Create a Database User: 
    - Username: 
    ```
    <copy>mongoUser</copy>
    ```
    - Password: 
    ```
    <copy>DBlearnPTS#22_</copy>
    ```

    To add or edit users, **click Security > Database Access** on the left side menu.

    ![MongoDB User](./images/task1/mongodb-user.png)
    ![Add MongoDB User](./images/task1/add-mongodb-user.png)
    
    > Note: Save the **username** and the **password** in your notes.
    > We recomend you to use the password as later on, it will be use for running Python scripts. If you consider changing it, remember that later on, you will need to modify the Python scripts manually.

6. On the **Cluster Overview Page**, Click **Connect**.

    ![MongoDBConnectCluster](./images/task1/mongodb-connect-cluster.png)

    - **Connect Your Application**: Python 3.6 or later
        You will receive a connection string like this:

    ````
    mongodb+srv://mongoUser:[password]@[cluster_name].[sub_domain_name].mongodb.net/[dbname]?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    ````

    ![MongoDB Connect Your App](./images/task1/mongodb-connect-your-app.png)
    ![MongoDB Connect String](./images/task1/mongodb-connect-string.png)
    
    > Note: Save this string in your notes. Replace `[password]` (DBlearnPTS#22_), `[cluster_name]` (Cluster0), `[sub_domain_name]` and `[dbname]` (SimpleDatabase) with your values.

7. Click the cluster name **Cluster0**. Under **Collections**, use **Load a Sample Dataset wizard** to generate some JSON documents for different use cases in your MongoDB database. **Navigate** these sample datasets and familiarize yourself with JSON documents, if this is your first experience.

    ![MongoDB Collections](./images/task1/mongodb-collections.png)
    ![MongoDB Load Sample](./images/task1/mongodb-load-sample.png)
    ![MongoDB Load Sample Two](./images/task1/mongodb-load-sample-two.png)

8. Click **Create Database**, and name it **SimpleDatabase**, and the collection **SimpleCollection**. This will be used for our Python application development in the next lab.

    - Database Name: **SimpleDatabase**
    ```
    <copy>SimpleDatabase</copy>
    ```
    - Collection Name: **SimpleDatabase**
    ```
    <copy>SimpleCollection</copy>
    ```

    ![MongoDB Create Database](./images/task1/mongodb-create-database.png)
    ![MongoDB Simple DB](./images/task1/mongodb-simple-db.png)

9. On the Collections left-side menu, select **SimpleDatabase** > **SimpleCollection**. This collection is now empty.

    ![MongoDB SimpleDB Empty](./images/task1/mongodb-simple-db-empty.png)


## Task 2: Develop dual document store micro-service

1. Access to **cloud shell** again. If you are not connected to **opc@devm**, **run** again the **ssh connections** using the **Public IP.** Replace <Public_IP> with your own one, removing < and > too. We copied the Public IP when we provisioned the compute instance few tasks back. Execute the following commands:

    ````
    <copy>
    ssh -i <private-key-file-name>.key opc@<Public_IP>
    </copy>
    ````

    ![ssh Connection](./images/task2/ssh.png)

2. We will **export** the **paths** and **Access** to python-simple-project folder using the following commands:

    ````
    <copy>
    export TNS_ADMIN=/home/opc/Wallet_AJDEV
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/oracle/21/client64/lib
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/oracle/21/client64/bin/
    cd python-simple-project
    . bin/activate
    </copy>
    ````

    ![Export Paths and Access to Python-simple-project](./images/task2/exports-access.png)

    > Note: We have run these commands before, if you are not desconnected from cloud shell, you don't have to run them again.

3. Lets have a look at **double-app.py**. In this file, we have the Python application code. Run the following command to see the code:

    ````
    <copy>
    cat double-app.py
    </copy>
    ````

    ![cat double-app part 1](./images/task2/cat-double-app.png)
    ![cat double-app part 2](./images/task2/cat2-double-app.png)

4. **Verify** all connection **variables are correct**. 

    - For the Oracle Autonomous JSON database connection: We are using **demo** user and the **password** that we have recommended during the workshop **DBlearnPTS#22_**.

    - For the MongoDB database connection: We are using **mongoUser** **user** and the **password** that we have recommended during the workshop **DBlearnPTS#22_**. We have hard-corded the **MongoDB cluster name**, having the default value **Cluster0**. We need the **MongoDB database name**, we have recommended using **SimpleDatabase**. We need too the **MongoDB database collection name**, we have recommended using **SimpleCollection**. And finally, we need the **subdomain name**. It is a **5 characters string** that you can find under the MongoDB connection variables window. We requested to copy it on Task 1 of this lab. 
    
    It should be something like this:

    ````
    mongodb+srv://mongoUser:[password]@[cluster_name].[sub_domain_name].mongodb.net/[dbname]?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    ````

    For **importing** the **subdomain name,** please write this command:

    ````
    <copy>
    export MONGO_DOMAIN="<sub_domain_name>"    
    </copy>
    ````

    > Note: If you have change the following variables to a different value, please run this commands providing the variable that you have changed.
    >
    ````
    export AJSON_USER="demo"
    export AJSON_PASSWORD="DBlearnPTS#22_"
    export AJSON_SERVICE="ajdev_tp"
    export MONGO_USER="mongoUser"
    export MONGO_PASSWORD="DBlearnPTS#22_"
    export MONGO_CLUSTER="Cluster0"
    export MONGO_DB="SimpleDatabase"
    export MONGO_COLLECTION="SimpleCollection"
    ````

5. **After checking if all variables are correct**. **Run** double-app application using the following command:

    ````
    <copy>
    nohup python3 double-app.py > double-app.log 2>&1 & echo $! > double.pid
    </copy>
    ````

    We are executing the double-app.py with **nohup function** for keep using the terminal for the following steps.
    
    At the same time, with this command, we are **creating a double-app.log** where you can check how the python app is behaving.
    
    Additionally we are **creating a file, double.pid,** to be capable of killing the python app to keep creating the third application for today’s content.

    ![double-app Execution](./images/task2/double-app-launch.png)

6. Lets see what **double-app.py is doing**, use the following command:

    ````
    <copy>
    cat double-app.log
    </copy>
    ````

    ![double-app log](./images/task2/double-app-log.png)

    If you followed the steps correctly, you should see this output in the cloud shell terminal. 

    **Your micro-service double-app.py is being executed** so we can start inserting the documents.

7. **Copy** the following commands to perform **POST request with CURL client**. Make sure you press **Enter** after each one. First and Second POST:

    ````
    <copy>
    curl --request POST \
            --url http://localhost:5000/mongo/ \
            --header 'content-type: application/json' \
            --data '{
        "company":"Company Five",
        "address": {
            "street": "6435 Avondale Dr",

            "country": "United States"
        },
        "industry":"Retail",
        "employees":5550
    }'
    curl --request POST \
            --url http://localhost:5000/mongo/ \
            --header 'content-type: application/json' \
            --data '{
        "company":"Company Six",
        "address": {
            "street": "15 1 Ave W",
            "city": "Lafleche",
            "country": "Canada"
        },
        "industry":"Health Sciences",
        "employees":123123
    }'
    </copy>
    ````

    ![POST company One curl](./images/task2/curl-company-five-six.png)

8. **Copy** the following commands to perform **POST request with CURL client**. Make sure you press **Enter** after each one. Third and Fourth POST:

    ````
    <copy>
    curl --request POST \
            --url http://localhost:5000/mongo/ \
            --header 'content-type: application/json' \
            --data '{
        "company":"Company Seven",
        "address": {
            "street": "Calle Martin Corchado 32",
            "city": "Ponce",
            "country": "Puerto Rico"
        },
        "industry":"Communications",
        "employees":112233
    }'
    curl --request POST \
            --url http://localhost:5000/mongo/ \
            --header 'content-type: application/json' \
            --data '{
        "company":"Company Eight",
        "address": {
            "street": "Asa Sul CLS 203 LOJA 06 - Asa Sul",
            "city": "Brasília",
            "country": "Brazil"
        },
        "industry":"Utilities",
        "employees":888
    }'
    </copy>
    ````

    ![POST company Third and Fourth curl](./images/task2/curl-company-seven-eight.png)


9. Use the **web browser** on your laptop to navigate to your micro-service to list JSON documents inserted into Oracle Autonomous Database.

    http://[DEVM public-ip address]:5000/mongo/

     ![Microservice Company Five, Six, Seven & Eight](./images/task2/microservice-company-five-six-seven-eight.png)
    
    > This micro-service has 2 URLs. We already had used the Oracle one on Lab 2, Task 1. Here you have the two URLS:
    >
        - http://[DEVM public-ip address]:5000/oracle/ -> for Oracle Autonomous Database
        - http://[DEVM public-ip address]:5000/mongo/ -> for MongoDB

10. We can check that the **Four Companies** (Five, Six, Seven and Eight) are being stored on **MongoDB** cloud, on **SimpleDatabase.SimpleCollection** that we created in Task 1 of this Lab.

    ![MongoDB Companies Added](./images/task2/mongodb-companies-added.png)
