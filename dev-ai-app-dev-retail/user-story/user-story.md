## Task 2: Demo - Customer with medium risk score

In this first example, you will use the application to authorize a return for a customer with a medium risk score. Select the third user on your to-do list David Williams.

1. On the Dashboard page, from the pending review list, select the review button for **David Williams**.

    ![Select David Williams](./images/david-williams.png =50%x*)

2. Opening David William's profile reveals his return authorization details—name, email, request status, loyalty tier, and risk level.  

    ![David Williams Details Page](./images/david-williams-details.png =50%x*)

3. At the bottom of David William’s profile, you will find **AI Guru**—a virtual Return‑Authorization Specialist who guides attendees through every step of the AI‑driven returns portal. AI Guru shows how to upload photos and order data, highlights how AI Vector Search compares each request to millions of past returns, and translates risk scores into plain language. It's friendly tips humanize concepts like graph‑based customer‑lifetime‑value analysis and RAG‑generated policy explanations, so users of any technical level can confidently approve, pend, or deny a return.

    **Copy** the question below into the AI chatbot and press **Enter**. What does AI Guru say?

    ```text

>💡 In Oracle Database 23ai, **AI Vector Search** allows you to combine your business data with a Large Language Model (LLM) to reduce hallucinations and get accurate answers from your data.

4. Select the **Navigate To Decisions** button.

    ![David Williams Decision](./images/david-williams-decision.png =50%x*)

    After navigating to the decisions page, the AI evaluation runs in the background. Using AI Vector Search, it semantically compares the content against thousands of historical return records—identifying patterns that suggest either legitimate claims or potential abuse. At the same time, Graph Analytics examines the customer’s prior behavior, highlighting unusual return frequency or links to high-risk product categories. For each case, the system assigns a risk score ranging from Low to Very High and generates a clear recommendation—such as “Approved – consistent with customer profile” or “Request More Info – insufficient documentation.”

5. In the **Select Your Desired Option Option** section, the approval probability and decision are displayed. Once a decision is made, the analyst finalizes the return. A professionally formatted PDF letter is automatically generated, summarizing the outcome and rationale. The customer receives an email moments later, clearly stating whether their return was approved, denied, or needs more information—along with an explanation grounded in policy and precedent.

    ![David Williams Decisions Page](./images/david-williams-decisions.png =50%x*)

6. Select the AI-recommended return decision. In this example, that is **Request More Info**. 

    >Please note that your results may vary. The information provided is generated by OCI Generative AI services, and your outcomes may differ from those presented.

    ![David Williams Select Request More Info](./images/david-williams-select.png =50%x*)

7. Set the final return status to **Request Info**, then click **Confirm Decision** to complete the process.

    The return status has been updated to 'Request Info' and saved to the customer profile.

    ![David Williams Save Return Status](./images/david-williams-save.png =50%x*)

8.  Click the **Download Decision as PDF** button.

    ![David Williams Generate PDF](./images/david-williams-generate-pdf.png =50%x*)

9.  Click **Download PDF**

    ![David Williams Download PDF](./images/david-williams-download.png =50%x*)

10. Display the message the customer would see by opening the downloaded PDF.

    ![Open David Williams PDF](./images/open-david-williams-pdf.png =50%x*)

11. Click the **Return to Dashboard** button to navigate back to the Dashboard.

    ![Return to Dashboard](./images/david-return-dashboard.png =50%x*)

12. Expand **View In Progress Customers**. We can see that David Williams has been removed from the **Pending Customers** list and has been added to the **In Progress Customers**.

    ![David Williams In Progress List](./images/david-in-progress.png =50%x*)

**Task Summary**

Once you select and save one of the 3 return options recommended by the AI: 

✅ The customer's return status is updated.

✅ A finalized PDF decision document is generated.  

✅ The dashboard reflects the change in real-time — marking David as In Progress.

Congratulations, you have just approved your first customer return! Proceed to the next task.

## Task 3: Demo - Denying a Customer with high risk
In this example, you will navigate the application to review a customer and deny them as part of the exercise. The first user on your to-do list is Alice Smith.

1. On the Dashboard page, from the pending review list, select the Review Button for **Alice Smith**.

    ![Select Alice Smith](./images/alice-smith.png =50%x*)

2. Opening Alice Smith’s profile displays her return package details. Within a few seconds, the AI automatically generates recommendations. In this case, the system evaluates a less favorable profile and identifies key risk factors.

    This customer has:

    * A lifetime spend of **$3301.29**
    * A transaction detail indicating **damaged item for order 5001**
    * A return frequency of **2**

    The AI evaluates the profile and suggests next steps. In this case, it recommends requesting more info—but also provides clear, explanations as to why the customer was put into a high risk category.

    ![Alice Smith AI generated recommendations](./images/alice-smith-ai.png =50%x*)

3. Select the **Navigate to Customer Decisions** button.

    ![Alice Smith Decision](./images/alice-smith-decision.png =50%x*)

>⁉️ **What are two reasons that the AI decided to deny this return?** ⁉️

4. Expand **Interactive Graph: Customer Return & Risk*** to view the graph.

    ![Alice Smith Graph](./images/expand-graph.png =50%x*)

    On the decision page, the return specialist can use **Interactive Graph: Customer Return & Risk** to explore relationships in return authorization scenarios. Built with **Oracle Graph**, this feature visually maps decisions and highlights important features of the request like the customer loyalty status and return reason.

    ![Alice Smith Graph](./images/alice-smith-graph.png =50%x*)

    This graph shows Alice’s return request linked to a policy rule (in-store within 30 days) and the system’s recommendation. By connecting the customer, request, reason, and policy in one view, the Operational Property Graph makes it clear why a return is approved, denied, or flagged. Analysts can instantly explain the decision to the customer, reducing disputes and building trust.

>💡 In Oracle Database 23ai, **Property Graph** allows you to treat your data like a network of connected points, where each point (called a node) and each link (called an edge) has its own details or properties. This setup helps you run graph analytics, to find important connections or patterns, directly within the database.

5. The return status is set to **Denied**. Click the **Confirm Decision** button.

    The return status has been updated to 'Denied' and saved to the customer profile.

    ![Alice Smith Return Status](./images/alice-smith-deny.png =50%x*)

6. Press the **Download Decision as PDF** button to save the AI responses and proceed to the final return authorization.

    ![Alice-Smith PDF](./images/alice-smith-pdf.png =50%x*)

7. Click the **Download PDF** button.

    ![Alice Smith Download Recommendation](./images/alice-smith-download.png =50%x*)

8. Display the message the customer would see by opening the downloaded PDF.

    ![Open Alice Smith PDF](./images/open-alice-smith-pdf.png =50%x*)

9. Click the **Return to Dashboard** button to navigate back to the Dashboard.

    ![Return to Dashboard](./images/smith-return-dashboard.png =50%x*)

10. Expand **View Denied Customers**. You will see that Alice Smith has been moved from the **Pending Customer** list to the **Denied Customers** list.

    ![Alice Smith Denied List](./images/smith-denied-list.png =50%x*)

**Conclusion**

Congratulations, you have finished reviewing a customer with high fraud risk! Proceed to the next task.

## Task 4: Demo - Update customer details

Lastly, let’s explore how the system uses JSON Duality Views to handle profile updates. In this task, you will edit a customer’s details. In this example, the customer was asked to submit updated proof of carrier tracking.

1. On the Dashboard page, from the **Pending Customers** list, select the review button for **Isla Wilson**.

    ![Select Isla Wilson](./images/isla-wilson.png =50%x*)

2. We will upload a document to update the item's return condition. On the Customer Details page, click the **Upload Document** button.

    ![Upload Document](./images/upload-document.png =50%x*)

3. The PDF file has been loaded. Click the **Process PDF** button.

    ![Click Process Selected PDF](./images/process-selected-pdf.png =50%x*)

>💡 **JSON Duality Views** in 23ai let's you update unstructured data in an easy, high-level format while automatically handling the technical details behind the scenes. This makes it faster and simpler to work with messy data and connect it to structured systems.

4. The customer profile has been updated.

    ![Customer Profile Updated](./images/profile-updated.png)

5. Navigate to the customer decisions page and notice that the information has been updated. Thanks to JSON Transform and JSON Duality Views, only the relevant field is modified — leaving the rest of the profile UNTOUCHED.

    ![Customer Profile Updated](./images/return-description-updated.png)

**Task Summary**

Once the document is uploaded:

✅ The system automatically detects the new item condition data.

✅ Then their profile will be updated for the return description.

✅ And thanks to JSON Transform and JSON Duality Views, only the relevant field is modified — leaving the rest of the profile UNTOUCHED.
