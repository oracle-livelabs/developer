1. On the Dashboard page, from the pending review list, select the Customer ID for **James Smith**.

    ![Select James Smith](./images/james-smith.png =50%x*)

2. Opening James Smith’s profile reveals his return authorization details—name, location, requested amount, debt, and credit score.  

    ![James Smith AI generated recommendations](./images/james-smith-ai.png =50%x*)

3. At the bottom of James Smith’s profile, you will find **AI Return Specialist**—a virtual Return‑Authorization Specialist who guides attendees through every step of the AI‑driven returns portal. Riley shows how to upload photos and order data, highlights how AI Vector Search compares each request to millions of past returns, and translates risk scores into plain language. Her friendly tips humanize concepts like graph‑based customer‑lifetime‑value analysis and RAG‑generated policy explanations, so users of any technical level can confidently approve, pend, or deny a return

    **Copy** the question below into the AI chatbot and press **Enter**. What does AI Return Specialist say?

    ![James Smith chatbot](./images/james-smith-chatbot.png =50%x*)

>💡 In Oracle Database 23ai, **AI Vector Search** allows you to combine your business data with the Large Language Model (LLM) to reduce hallucinations and get accurate answers from your data.

4. Select the **Navigate To Decisions** button.

    ![James Smith Decision](./images/james-smith-decision.png =50%x*)

    After navigating to the decisions page, the AI evaluation runs in the background. Using AI Vector Search, it semantically matches the content against thousands of historical return records—identifying patterns that suggest either legitimate claims or potential abuse. At the same time, Graph Analytics examines the customer’s prior behavior, highlighting unusual return frequency or links to high-risk product categories. For each case, the system assigns a risk score ranging from Low to Very High and generates a clear recommendation—such as “Approved – consistent with customer profile” or “Request More Info – insufficient documentation.”

5. In the **Select Final Approved Return Option** section, the risk score and decision are displayed. Once a decision is made, the analyst finalizes the return. A professionally formatted PDF letter is automatically generated, summarizing the outcome and rationale. The customer receives an email moments later, clearly stating whether their return was approved, denied, or needs more information—along with an explanation grounded in policy and precedent.

    ![James Smith Select Final Approved Loan](./images/james-smith-select-final-loan.png =50%x*)

6. Select the AI-recommended return decision. In this example, that is **Approved**. 

    >Please note that your results may vary. The information provided is generated by OCI Generative AI services, and your outcomes may differ from those presented.

    ![James Smith Select Loan 3](./images/james-smith-select-loan.png =50%x*)

7. Set the final return status to **Approved**, then click **Save Final Approval & Return Status** to complete the process.

    The return status has been updated to 'Approved' and saved to the customer profile.

    ![James Smith Save Loan Status](./images/james-smith-save.png =50%x*)

8.  Click the **Generate Decision as PDF** button.

    ![James Smith Download Recommendation](./images/james-smith-download.png =50%x*)

9.  Click **Download PDF**

    ![James Smith Download PDF](./images/james-smith-download-pdf.png =50%x*)

10. Display the message the customer would see by opening the downloaded PDF.

    ![Open James Smith PDF](./images/open-james-smith-pdf.png =50%x*)

11. Click the **Return to Dashboard** button to navigate back to the Dashboard.

    ![Return to Dashboard](./images/james-return-dashboard.png =50%x*)

12. Expand **View Approved Customers**. We can see that James Smith has been removed from the Pending Review Return Requests list and has been added to the Approved Return Requests list.

    ![James Smith Approved List](./images/james-smith-approved-list.png =50%x*)

**Conclusion**

Once you select and save one of the 3 return options recommended by the AI: 

✅ The customer's return status is updated.

✅ A finalized PDF decision document is generated.  

✅ The dashboard reflects the change in real-time — marking James as Approved.

Congratulations, you have just approved your first customer return! Proceed to the next task.

## Task 3: Demo - Denying a customer with high risk
In this example, you will navigate the application to review a customer and deny them as part of the exercise. The second user on your to-do list is James Woods.

1. On the Dashboard page, from the pending review list, select the Customer ID for **James Woods**.

    ![Select James Woods](./images/james-woods.png =50%x*)

2. Opening James Woods’s profile displays his return package details. Within a few seconds, the AI generates automatically recommendations. In this case, the system evaluates a less favorable profile and identifies key risk factors.

    This return has: [placeholder]

    * **Identifiable Damage**
    * An **unusual return frequency**
    * And has links to **high risk product categories**

    Despite the risk factors, the AI evaluates the profile and suggests next steps. In this case, it recommends a denial—but also provides clear, actionable guidance to help the customer improve their chances of approval in the future.

    ![James Woods AI generated recommendations](./images/james-woods-ai.png =50%x*)

3. Select the **Navigate to Decisions** button.

    ![James Woods Decision](./images/james-woods-decision.png =50%x*)

>⁉️ **What are two reasons that the AI decided to deny this return?** ⁉️


4. Expand **View Dot Plot: Customer-Return Relationships** to view the graph.

    ![James Woods Graph](./images/expand-graph.png =50%x*)

    On the decision page, the return specialist can use **Operational Property Graph** to explore near-approval return scenarios. Built with **Oracle Graph**, this feature visually maps loans just out of reach and highlights what adjustments—like increasing loyalty tier or reducing refund frequency—could improve eligibility.

    ![James Woods Graph](./images/james-woods-graph2.png =50%x*)

>💡 In Oracle Database 23ai, **Property Graph** allows you to treat your data like a network of connected points, where each point (called a node) and each link (called an edge) has its own details or properties. This setup helps you run graph analytics, like finding important connections or patterns, directly within the database.

5. The return status is set to **Denied**. Click the **Save Final Approval & Return Status** button.

    The return status has been updated to 'Denied' and saved to the customer profile.

    ![James Woods Save Loan Status](./images/james-woods-save.png =50%x*)

6. Press the **Generate Decision as PDF** button to save the AI responses and proceed to the final return authorization.

    ![James Woods PDF](./images/james-woods-pdf.png =50%x*)

7. Click the **Download PDF** button.

    ![James Woods Download Recommendation](./images/james-woods-download.png =50%x*)

8. Display the message the customer would see by opening the downloaded PDF.

    ![Open James Woods PDF](./images/open-james-woods-pdf.png =50%x*)

9. Click the **Return to Dashboard** button to navigate back to the Dashboard.

    ![Return to Dashboard](./images/woods-return-dashboard.png =50%x*)

10. Expand **View Denied Customers**. You will see that James Woods has been moved from the **Pending Review Return Requests** list to the **Denied Return Requests** list.

    ![James Woods Denied List](./images/james-woods-denied-list.png =50%x*)

**Conclusion**

Congratulations, you have finished reviewing a customer with high fraud risk! Proceed to the next task.

## Task 4: Demo - Update customer details

Lastly, let’s explore how the system uses JSON Duality Views to handle profile updates. In this task, you will edit a customer’s details. In this example, the customer was asked to submit updated proof of carrier tracking.

1. On the Dashboard page, from the **Pending Review Return Requests** list, select the customer ID for **Alex Anderson**.

    ![Select Alex Anderson](./images/select-alex-anderson.png =50%x*)

2. We will upload a document to update the item's condition. Before uploading the document, note that the item's condition is currently listed as "none". On the Customer Details page, click the **Upload Document** button.

    ![Upload Document](./images/upload-document.png =50%x*)

3. The PDF file has been loaded. Click the **Process Selected PDF** button.

    ![Click Process Selected PDF](./images/process-selected-pdf.png =50%x*)

>💡 **JSON Duality Views** in 23ai let's you update unstructured data in an easy, high-level format while automatically handling the technical details behind the scenes. This makes it faster and simpler to work with messy data and connect it to structured systems.

4. The customer profile has been updated.

    ![Customer Profile Updated](./images/profile-updated.png)

5. Refresh the page and note that the item condition has been updated to "Damaged". Thanks to JSON Transform and JSON Duality Views, only the relevant field is modified — leaving the rest of the profile UNTOUCHED.

    ![Customer Profile Updated](./images/income-updated.png)

**Conclusion**

Once the document is uploaded:

✅ The system automatically detects the new item condition data.

✅ Then their profile will be updated from "none" to "Damaged".

✅ And thanks to JSON Transform and JSON Duality Views, only the relevant field is modified — leaving the rest of the profile UNTOUCHED.
