# üîç Discover and View your Database and Data Lake Assets from your Data Catalog

## Introduction

This lab is designed to demonstrate how tools in Oracle‚Äôs Data Platform can be used to discover and provide access data in cloud object storage.   

Having this access is crucial for someone,such as the loan approval officer in our demo, because it directly impacts their ability to efficiently, securely, and compliantly perform their duties.  

Estimated Lab Time: 45 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Find your LiveLabs Sandbox reservations

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle account to submit your a LiveLabs Sandbox reservation.

## Task 1: Navigate to Autonomous Database

To begin, we will log onto the assigned Autonomous Database and launch Database Actions (as the LOAN user), so you can discover and manage all the data you have access to all from one location.

1. Log onto Oracle Cloud account at cloud.oracle.com

    ![Log onto Oracle Cloud account](./images/logon-oracle-cloud.png " ")  

    Click the menu icon (three horizontal lines) in top left corner to open the Navigation Menu  

1. Select Oracle Database from the Navigation Menu.  

    ![Select DB from Navigation Menu](./images/select-db-from-nav-menu.png " ")

1. Choose the database type  

    ![Select DB from Navigation Menu](./images/select-db-type.png " ")
    Click on Autonomous Database.

1. Select the desired database  

    ![Select DB from Navigation Menu](./images/select-adb-from-list.png " ")
    Click the name of the Autonomous Database you want to use  

1. Launch Database Actions  

    ![ADB Details | DB Actions](./images/adb-detail-2-data-load.png " ")  

    Click Database Actions, then select Data Load from the dropdown list   

## Task 2: Setup Connection to Object Storage

Starting where we ended Task 1, let‚Äôs set up a connection between the Data Catalog and your specific buckets of data and available data shares.  

1. Navigate to Connections  

    ![Add Connections to Catalog](./images/expand-data-load-options.png "Add Connections to Catalog")  
    Expand the Data Load options on the left rail, then select Connections 

1. Review Existing Connections  

    ![Add Connections to Catalog](./images/add-connections-to-catalog-2.png "Add Connections to Catalog")  
    On the connections page you will note that this lab already has 4 bucket connections established.

1. Create New Connection  

    ![Add Connections to Catalog](./images/add-connections-to-catalog-3.png "Add Connections to Catalog")  
    Click **Create**, then select **New Cloud Store Location**  

1. Enter Connection Details

    ![Add Connections to Catalog](./images/add-connections-to-catalog-4-w-select-bucket.png "Add Connections to Catalog")  
    Enter details about the cloud store location as shown, then click Create button

1. Confirm Connection Creation

    ![Add Connections to Catalog](./images/add-connections-to-catalog-5.png "Add Connections to Catalog")  
    Review available connections in the Data Catalog, that are accessible to the LOAN schema. 

    **Congratulations you have successfully added your own object storage connection to the Catalog!**  

## Task 3: Explore the Data Catalog

With our Connections in place, we will explore how to search the catalog for the items you want to see, by selecting what schemas, and what entity types to display  

1. Launch Catalog Landing Page  

    ![Search Items in Catalog](./images/search-items-in-catalog-1.png "Search Items in Catalog")  
    Select Catalog from the left rail to proceed to the landing page.  

1. Identify Data Objects in the Catalog

    ![Search Items in Catalog](./images/search-items-in-catalog-2.png "Search Items in Catalog")  
    To help customize search results, you will find ‚Äúquick filters‚Äù on the landing page, to limit output to all or a selected schema

1. Preview Data in the Catalog

    ![Data Catalog CSV preview](./images/data-catalog-csv-preview.png "Data Catalog CSV Preview")  

    Locate the file named LoanAppCustomer-Extensions.csv.  Hover over it to display the file's contents 
    
    
    >**NOTE:**Notice we are able to preview the contents of a file without having to load it into the database.  

    Click on **Close**

    **Congratulations you have successfully previewed the contents of your Object Storage Data!**
