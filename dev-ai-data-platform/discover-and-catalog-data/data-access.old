# Enable Real Time Data Access

## Lab Summary 
In this lab, you’ll learn how to find, connect, and use data from Object Storage via Oracle’s Data Catalog and Autonomous Database (ADB). Follow these steps to set up everything you need for seamless, real-time data access—without jumping through complicated hoops. After these steps, you’ll have a smooth setup that lets you discover, connect, and query data no matter where it lives—in Oracle Database or in Object Storage—giving you a powerful, unified view of all your information. Enjoy exploring!

## Task 1: Connect to Data Catalog 

First, you’ll log into an existing Data Catalog so you can discover and manage your data all in one place

## Task 2: Create Business Glossary for Catalog 

Before we get too far along, you will setup a business glossary for our catalog.  A business glossary enables teams within an organization to collaborate better and use the same vocabulary. 

## Task 3: Register OCI Object Storage as a Data Asset in Catalog 

You’ll let the Catalog know about your Object Storage (think of it like telling your library about a new shelf).

## Task 4: Add Data Asset to Catalog for Oracle Object Storage Data Buckets

Then, you’ll set up links between the Data Catalog and your specific buckets of data. 

## Task 5: Harvest Data Assets to Extract Data Structure into Catalog

You’ll scan your Object Storage to discover file structures (like scanning a bookshelf to note all the titles). 

## Task 6: View Harvested Data Entities 

Check out the list of discovered data inside the Catalog. 

## Task 7: Sync ADB and Data Catalog 

The last step in the chain is for you to sync your ADB instance to your catalog so you can create External Tables that let you query Object Storage data right from the database.

## Task 8: Query Data in ADB and Data Lake (Object Storage) from within ADB 

Finally, you’ll run queries in ADB that reach into data that resides in standard database tables and Object Storage—all in one place, like checking out multiple library shelves at once.
