# Load, Link, and Query Object Storage Data from Autonomous Database

## Introduction

IThis lab focuses on loading, linking, and querying object storage data directly from your Autonomous Database instance. You'll learn how to make object storage data locally available for performance optimization or cost reduction while maintaining flexibility for real-time analytics. Using Oracle Data Catalog, you'll link object storage data to your database and create external tables that allow direct querying without time-consuming transfers. Finally, you'll run cross-source queries that combine structured database tables with object storage data to deliver a unified view of financial insights.

By the end of this lab, you will:

   * ***Load Data:*** Understand how to move object storage data into tables in your Autonomous Database for improved performance and persistence.

   * ***Link Data:*** Use Oracle Data Catalog to connect object storage assets to your database.

   * ***Query Data:*** Create external tables to query object storage data directly and combine it with database tables for unified analytics.

## Task 1: Load Object Storage Data into Autonomous Database using Data Catalog

   1. Navigate to your Assigned ADB Instance

    * Open Navigation Menu 
    * Select Oracle Database 
    * Select Autonomous Database
