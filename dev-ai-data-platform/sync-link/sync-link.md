# Load, Link, and Query Object Storage Data from Autonomous Database

## Introduction

This lab is designed to give the Data Engineer/Architect experience utilizing the **Data Load** tools, to gain access to data that resides inside the database on cloud object storage.  

This lab will give you the skills to load, link, and query object storage data directly from your **Autonomous Database** instance.  

You'll learn how to make object storage data locally available for performance optimization or cost reduction while maintaining flexibility for real-time analytics.  

Using **Oracle Data Catalog**, you'll link object storage data to your database and create external tables that allow direct querying without time-consuming transfers.  

Finally, you'll run cross-source queries that combine structured database tables with object storage data to deliver a unified view of financial insights.

By the end of this lab, you will:

   * ***Load Data:*** Understand how to move object storage data into tables in your Autonomous Database when required for improved performance, persistence, or cost savings.

   * ***Link Data:*** Use Oracle Data Catalog to connect object storage assets to your database.

   * ***Query Database & Object Storage Data:*** Query object storage data directly and combine it with data in database tables for unified analytics.
