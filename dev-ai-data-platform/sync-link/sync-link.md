# Load, Link, and Query Object Storage Data from Autonomous Database

## Introduction

This lab is designed to give the Data Engineer/Architect experience utilizing the **Data Load** tools, to gain access to data that resides inside the database on cloud object storage.  

This lab will give you the skills to load, link, and query object storage data directly from your **Autonomous Database** instance.  

You'll learn how to make object storage data locally available for performance optimization or cost reduction while maintaining flexibility for real-time analytics.  

Using **Oracle Data Catalog**, you'll link object storage data to your database and create external tables that allow direct querying without time-consuming transfers.  

Finally, you'll run cross-source queries that combine structured database tables with object storage data to deliver a unified view of financial insights. 

Estimated Time: 45 minutes

### Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:

- **Load Data:** Understand how to move object storage data into tables in your Autonomous Database when required for improved performance, persistence, or cost savings.  

- **Link Data:** Use Oracle Data Catalog to connect object storage assets to your database.  

- **Query Database & Object Storage Data:** Query object storage data directly and combine it with data in database tables for unified analytics.  

## Task 1: Load Object Storage Data into Autonomous Database using Data Catalog

1. Click **View Login Info**. Copy your DB ADMIN Password and click the **SQL Worksheet** link.

9. Click the **Start** button on the Data Load page.  

      ![Create Data Product Share](./images/task1-scrn-13.png "Create Data Product Share")  

10. Click the **Run** button in the popup window, to start a job that loads data from the Cloud Store.  

      ![Create Data Product Share](./images/run-load.png "Create Data Product Share") 

11. The table will appear on the Table and View Loads page, once the job is completed. To generate a report and review the SQL used for the job, click on the **Report** button.  

      ![Create Data Product Share](./images/task1-scrn-14.png "Create Data Product Share")  

12. Click the **Close** button when finished.  

      ![Create Data Product Share](./images/task1-scrn-15.png "Create Data Product Share")  

13. To review details about the data in the table using SQL Worksheet, click on the **Query** button.  

      ![Create Data Product Share](./images/task1-scrn-16.png "Create Data Product Share")  

14. The SQL Worksheet will appear with the query pre-loaded, the query results available, and an analysis of the data set.  

      ![Create Data Product Share](./images/task1-scrn-17.png "Create Data Product Share")  

15. Select **Catalog** from the left rail and take note that the **Customer_Extension** table now appears in the Catalog.

   **Congratulations you have now loaded your Object Storage discovered in your catalog data into your ADB.**

## Task 2: Link Object Storage Data from Data Catalog to ADB.

   1. From the Data Catalog page with Data Objects selected, make sure the Cloud Object filter is selected, then select **LoanAppCustomer_segment.csv** from the list for the Cloud Object Entity page.
