# Share Data Products to Marketplace

## Lab Summary

In this section, you’ll learn how to share your newly created data products (special views of data) to a Marketplace so that different departments can easily access the information they need. Think of it like publishing two different “apps” for your data: one for the Risk Officer and one for the Marketing Officer. By the end of these Tasks, you’ll see how publishing data products in a central Marketplace can save each team time and effort, making it simple for the Risk and Marketing officers to access and use the exact data that matters to them.


## Task 1: Data Product for Risk Officer
