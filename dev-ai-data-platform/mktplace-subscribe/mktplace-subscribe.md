# ðŸ›’ Subscribe to Data Products via Data Share Tool

## Introduction

At SeersEquities, speed and precision are everythingâ€”especially for the Risk team. They need access to the latest loan data the moment it's available, without hunting it down or requesting manual updates.

In this lab, youâ€™ll step into the role of a data share recipient and learn how to subscribe to live data products published by the Loan team using Oracleâ€™s Data Share tool. Subscribing is like following a trusted data source: you always get the latest updates, automatically and securely.

By the end of this lab, youâ€™ll understand how subscriptions help the Risk team stay aligned with the businessâ€”so they can evaluate changes quickly, adjust risk models, and support smarter decisions in real time.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

      ![Create Data Product Share](./images/select-shared-data-6.png )

You created an external table from a shared datasetâ€”linking live loan data directly into your environment without copying it. This step gives the Risk team immediate, governed access to trusted data, ready for queries and analysis.

## Task 3: Validate ADB Access to Object Storage Data

1. Click the **Report** button for this link job to view details on rows processed and the SQL used.

   Clickâ€¯**Close**â€¯when finished.

   ![Create Data Product Share](./images/select-shared-data-1a.png )

2. In the Table and View Loads section, click the external table link **Shared\_Loan\_Data\_Risk** to preview the data. The source for this external table is the **Shared\_Loan\_Data\_Risk\_VW** data share.

   ![Create Data Product Share](./images/select-shared-data-2a.png )

   The preview panel opens by default, showing the external tableâ€™s data.

   ![Create Data Product Share](./images/select-shared-data-3a.png )

3. Click **Close** to return to the **Data Share Dashboard**.

4. Click **Query** to run a query against the linked shared data from Autonomous Database.

   ![Create Data Product Share](./images/select-shared-data-4a.png )

Youâ€™ve now subscribed to a shared data product and validated that you can query it directly from Autonomous Database. This ensures the Risk team at SeersEquities can work with live, trusted dataâ€”ready for real-time analysis without unnecessary data movement.

## Conclusion

In this lab, you subscribed to a shared data product, linked it as an external table, and successfully queried live data from Autonomous Database. Youâ€™ve seen how Oracleâ€™s Data Share tool helps teams like SeersEquitiesâ€™ Risk Department securely access the latest loan dataâ€”without duplication, delays, or manual handoffs.

This workflow ensures faster risk analysis, smarter decisions, and tighter collaboration across the businessâ€”all powered by governed, trusted data.
