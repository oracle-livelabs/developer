#### Estimated Lab Time: 30 minutes

## Introduction

In this lab, you’ll learn how to **subscribe** to data products published in the **Data Marketplace**. Subscribing works like “**following**” a channel, ensuring you receive the **latest updates** as new information becomes available.

By the end of this lab, you’ll understand how the **Data Marketplace** enables teams to easily **discover and access customized data products**, keeping everyone aligned and ready to act on **up-to-date information**.
