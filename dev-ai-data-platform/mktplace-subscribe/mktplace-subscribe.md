# ðŸ›’ Subscribe to Data Products via Data Share Tool

## Introduction

At SeersEquities, speed and precision are everythingâ€”especially for the Risk team. They need access to the latest loan data the moment it's available, without hunting it down or requesting manual updates.

In this lab, youâ€™ll step into the role of a data share recipient and learn how to subscribe to live data products published by the Loan team using Oracleâ€™s Data Share tool. Subscribing is like following a trusted data source: you always get the latest updates, automatically and securely.

By the end of this lab, youâ€™ll understand how subscriptions help the Risk team stay aligned with the businessâ€”so they can evaluate changes quickly, adjust risk models, and support smarter decisions in real time.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

* **Subscribe** to a published data product using the Data Share tool

      ![Create Data Product Share](./images/subscribe-to-share-provider.png )

   Click on **Next** to proceed

7. On the **Add Shares** screen:

   Select theâ€¯**LoanApp\_ShareToRisk**â€¯share in the **Available Shares** column

   Click on **Subscribe** to proceed.

You successfully subscribed to a share provider, which is now linked to your Autonomous Database.

## Task 2: Link Data: Create External Tables to Data Share

1. On the Link Data page **select drop-down list** select the **Demo-Data-Share.**

   ![Create Data Product Share](./images/selectshareprovider.png )

2. Expand the drill down tab forâ€¯the share named **LoanApp\_Share\_Provider**â€¯to display the available data.

   ![Create Data Product Share](./images/available.png )

3. Drag and drop the file **LOAN.Shared\_Loan\_Data\_Risk\_VW** into the data linking job area.

   ![Create Data Product Share](./images/select-shared-data-2.png)

      >**NOTE:** This causes the external table to be created is displayed in the data linking job section.  

   ![Create Data Product Share](./images/select-shared-data-3.png)

4. Click the **Settings** icon (pencil) to open the configuration panel. Use the tabs on the left to:

      ![Create Data Product Share](./images/editshare.png )

      * Rename the external table to: **SHARED\_LOAN\_DATA\_RISK**

      ![Create Data Product Share](./images/select-shared-data-4.png )

      * Clickâ€¯**Close**â€¯to proceed

5. Click **Start** to create shared link.

6. Click **Run** in the pop window.

      ![Create Data Product Share](./images/select-shared-data-5.png )

7. Once the job is complete, check for the link icon next to the data link card to confirm success.

      ![Create Data Product Share](./images/select-shared-data-6.png )

You created an external table from a shared datasetâ€”linking live loan data directly into your environment without copying it. This step gives the Risk team immediate, governed access to trusted data, ready for queries and analysis.



## Task 3: Validate ADB Access to Object Storage Data

1. Click theâ€¯Reportâ€¯button for this link job to view a report of the total rows processed successfully and failed for the selected table and the SQL used.

   ðŸ”˜ Clickâ€¯**Close**â€¯when done.

   ![Create Data Product Share](./images/select-shared-data-1a.png )

1. In the **Table and View Loads** section:

   ðŸ”˜ Click the external table link named **Shared\_Loan\_Data\_Risk** to preview its data.  Remember, that the source data for this external table is from the **Shared\_Loan\_Data\_Risk\_VW** data share.

   ![Create Data Product Share](./images/select-shared-data-2a.png )

   The **Shared\_Loan\_Data\_Risk\_VW** panel is displayed with theâ€¯**Preview** tab selected by default that displays the external table's data.

   ![Create Data Product Share](./images/select-shared-data-3a.png )

1. Clickâ€¯**Close**â€¯to exit the panel and to return to the Data Share Dashboard.

1. Click on **Query** button to run a query from ADB against the Linked Shared Data

   ![Create Data Product Share](./images/select-shared-data-4a.png )

***Congratulations you have now subscribed to the data shared with you from ADB via Data Share and confirmed you can query the data.***
