# ðŸ§  Hackathon Challenge  

## Introduction  

**Welcome to the Hackathon Challenge!**  

The data science team at SeerEquities is focused on building a data-driven approval system.  Currently, the objective is to share loan information with the Marketing team.  

This lab guides you through creating and sharing data products using Oracle Data Platform tools.  

As a share provider, you will create a data share and add a table to it.  Next, you will setup a recipient that will have access to that data share.  

Finally, you will publish the data share and send the recipient an activation link needed to access the data share.  

In this lab, you will:  
*  Utilize a data share provider account (**LOAN user**) that logs in and manages the data shares for the recipients of the data share (**MARKETING user**)  
*  Leverage an Object Storage bucket to store the shared data - **MyDemoBucket**  
*  Create and publish data share - **LoanApp\_SharetoMarket**  
*  Create and authorize a data share recipient
