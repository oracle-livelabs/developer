# Create Data Products & Share to Marketplace 

## Lab Summary 

In this part of the workshop, you’ll learn how to create data products— which are special, customized views of your data—so different departments can use them more easily. Think of it like creating two different “windows” into the same data, each showing what a particular team cares about most. By the end, you’ll see how one set of data can be filtered or shaped into different data products, each perfectly fitting the needs of a specific department—without copying everything over or making it super complicated. 

In this lab, you will also learn how to share your newly created data products (special views of data) to a Marketplace so that different departments can easily access the information they need. Think of it like publishing two different “apps” for your data: one for the Risk Officer and one for the Marketing Officer. By the end of these Tasks, you’ll see how publishing data products in a central Marketplace can save each team time and effort, making it simple for the Risk and Marketing officers to access and use the exact data that matters to them. 

## Task 1: Create Data Product View for Risk Dept: Client_Loans_Risk_Dept_View 

* You’ll build a custom view (like a special lens) for the Risk Department. 

* It will include only the loan details and fields the Risk team needs to analyze, helping them make smarter decisions about potential risks. 

## Task 2: Share Data Product to Marketplace for Risk Officer Consumption

* You’ll take the output of the Client_Loans_Risk_Dept_View you created and publish it to the Data Marketplace. 

* This makes it easier for the Risk Officer to find, select, and use the data without having to ask for manual reports.
