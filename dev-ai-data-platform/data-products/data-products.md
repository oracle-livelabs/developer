# Create Data Product Share & Publish to Data Share

## Lab Summary 

In this Lab, you will:
 *  Utilize a data share provider account (LOAN user) that logs in and manages the data shares for the recipients of the data share (RISK and MARKETING users)
 *  Leverage an Object Storage bucket to store the shared data - MySharedBucket
 *  Create and publish data shares - LoanApp_Share2Marketing & LoanApp_Share2Risk
 *  Create and authorize a data share recipient
 
## Prerequisites 

*	An Oracle account

    ### Prerequisites for Share Providers to use the share tool:
    *   For a versioned share, you must have read and write access to a bucket to store or cache your shares.
    *   The schema you wish to use to create and publish shares must be enabled by an ADMIN user. 

    ### Prerequisites for Share Recipients
    *   The share recipient must have a valid email address a provider can use to register the recipient to use the share tool. Oracle Data Share allows you to share the recipient's activation link by email.

## Terminology


### Autonomous Database Share: 
    Includes the ability to:
*       Share objects easily across Autonomous Databases and all tools or APIs that support the open delta sharing protocol.
*       Share versioned data with many recipients without data replication for all recipients.
*       Establish secure and centrally managed data sharing and collaboration within and across organizations.
 
### Provider: 
    The Autonomous Database Serverless enables the provider to share existing objects. 
    The share can contain a single table, a set of related tables, or a set of tables with some logical grouping. 
    It could be a person, an institution, or a software system that shares the objects. 
 
    Example: An institution, such as NASA, that makes a data set available via data.gov.

### Recipient: 
    A Share recipient is an entity that associates an individual, an institution or a software system that receives a share from a provider. A recipient can have access to multiple shares. If you remove a recipient, that recipient loses access to all shares it could previously access. 
 
    Example: An external system, such as Microsoft Power BI, that supports the Delta Sharing REST API.
 
### Share: 
    A Share is a named entity in the providerâ€™s instance. 
    It can be a group of datasets shared as a single entity. 
 
    Example: A SALES table that needs to be shared within an organization.
