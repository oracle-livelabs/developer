# 🛠️ Create and Share Data Products

## Introduction

In this lab, as a share provider, you will create a data share and add a table to it. Next, you will create a new recipient that will have access to this data share.

Finally, you will publish the data share and send the recipient the activation link needed to access the data share.

In this Lab, you will:

* Utilize a data share provider account (**LOAN user**) that logs in and manages the data shares for the recipients of the data share (**RISK and MARKETING users**)
* Leverage an Object Storage bucket to store the shared data - **MyDemoBucket**
* Create and publish data shares - **LoanApp\_ShareToMarketing & LoanApp\_ShareToRisk**
* Create and authorize a data share recipient

### Prerequisites

* **Prerequisites for Share Providers to use the share tool:**
      * For a versioned share, you must have **read and write access to a bucket** to store or cache your shares.
      * The schema you wish to use to create and publish shares must be **enabled for Data Sharing by an ADMIN user.**
      * Creation of Cloud Location to Publish Share (Lab 3 task 2)

* **Prerequisites for Share Recipients**
      * The share recipient must have a **valid email address** a provider can use to register the recipient to use the share tool. Oracle Data Share allows you to share the recipient's activation link by email.
