# üõ†Ô∏è Create and Share Data Products

## Introduction

At SeersEquities, making smart credit decisions doesn't stop at creating great data‚Äîit depends on getting that data into the right hands, fast. <br>
The loan team may close deals, but it‚Äôs the risk team that needs to evaluate those deals in near real time.

In this lab, you‚Äôll act as a data provider, creating and sharing a data product that includes recently closed loans. You‚Äôll publish this share and authorize a recipient account (used by the risk team) to access it securely.

By the end of this lab, you‚Äôll know how to build, share, and govern data products using Autonomous Database and Object Storage‚Äîso SeersEquities can collaborate across teams without duplicating data or compromising security.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this Lab, you will:

* **Create a data share provider** user that creates and manages the data share and the recipients of the data share

* **Create and authorize a data share recipients**

* **Define an object storage bucket location** to store the shared data

* **Create and publish** a data share

 
### Prerequisites 

* **For Share Providers**

    * You have read and write access to an Object Storage bucket for storing or caching shared data (required for versioned shares).

    * The schema you'll use to publish the share has been enabled for Data Sharing by an ADMIN user.

    * You‚Äôve already created a **Cloud Location** to **Publish the Share** (covered in **Discover and View your Database and Data Lake Assets from your Data Catalog**, Task 2).

* **For Share Recipients**

    * The recipient must have a valid email address that the provider can use to register them. Oracle Data Share sends the activation link to this address.

      * **Name:** LoanApp\_Share\_Provider
      * **Email:** myemail@mycompany.com
      * **Description:** Loan team data sharing provider

      ![Define a Data Product Recipient](./images/define-data-product-share-recipient-5.png "Define a Data Product Recipient")

      * Click **Save**.

7. Back on the **Provide Share** page, click **Shares**, then click **Create Share** to launch the **Create Share wizard**.

8. On the first page of the wizard, enter:

      *  **Name:** LoanApp\_ShareToRisk
      *  **Description:** Sharing of data on sold loan products

   ![Define a Data Product Recipient](./images/create-share-general-risk.png "Define a Data Product Recipient")

      * Click **Next**.

9. In the **Publish Details** section, select the cloud location for publishing:

      * Select **MyDemoBucket** from the drop-down list.

   ![Create Share](./images/create-share-bucket.png "Define a Data Product Recipient")

      * Click **Next**.

10. On the **Select Tables** page, choose the table to share with the **Risk Department**:

      *  Select the **Share\_Loan\_Data\_Risk\_VW** table in the **Available Tables** column.
      *  Click the **move (>)** button to add it to the **Shared Tables** column

12. In the **Create Share Recipient** window, enter the following:

      *  **Name:** Risk\_Dept\_Lead  
      *  **Description:** Risk Department Data Engineering Lead
      *  **Email:** risk@mycompany.com

    ![Define a Data Product Recipient](./images/create-share-recipient-risk.png "Define a Data Product Recipient")

      * Click **Create**.

13. Back on the **Create Share** page, select the newly created recipient from the list of recipients.

   ![Define a Data Product Recipient](./images/selectrecipientdrop.png "Define")

14. Click the **Copy** icon to copy the recipient's activation link to your clipboard.

    ![Define a Data Product Recipient](./images/create-risk-recipient.png "Define a Data Product Recipient")

      * Click **Create**.
  
15. Now, publish your share by clicking the **Publish** button from the actions menu.

   ![publish Data Product ](./images/publishshare.png "")

16. This will turn the Share Icon green with a state of Published Share.  

   ![created Data Product ](./images/sharecreated.png "")

   >***Congratulations!!!*** You‚Äôve just **created and published a data product share**. <br> 
   By defining the share, selecting the right data, and authorizing a recipient, you‚Äôve set up a **governed, reusable pipeline for cross-team collaboration**.


## Task 2: Manage the Data Product Share

1. **Download the Activation Link Profile for the Data Share** that we will use in the upcoming lab <br>
Paste the activation link you copied earlier into a separate browser tab and click **Get Profile Information** to download the recipient profile file (The default name is `delta_share_profile.json`).

>If you experience an error with your activation link don't worry, the steps below will show you how to get a new copy and try again.

   ![Data Product activation link](./images/Paste-activation-link-in-window.png "")

2. A list of **share recipients** and their **Profile Activation link** can also be retrieved from the **Provide Share** page, by clicking the **Actions** icon next to your data product share. <br> Then selecting **Recipients and Profiles**.

   ![created Data Product ](./images/manageshare.png "")

3. From the **Recipients and Profiles** page, you can select and remove an existing recipients or add a new recipient to the data share.

      ![Define a Data Product Recipient](./images/manage-data-product-share-risk-3.png "Define a Data Product Recipient")

      Click **Cancel** to proceed to next lab steps.

4. From the **Provide Share** page, you can also get a list of share recipients and their profile activation links by clicking on  **Recipients** to display the recipients for the data share. <br> For each recipient you can select the actions icon to retrieve their activation profile link.

***Congratulations!*** You‚Äôve now successfully shared a governed, ready-to-query dataset from Autonomous Database with the Risk Department Lead‚Äîempowering them with the data they need to make informed decisions.

## Conclusion

In this lab, you **created and shared a live, query-ready data product**‚Äîgiving the Risk team secure, timely access to critical loan insights. You defined the data provider, configured the share, added a recipient, and managed access‚Äîall without moving or duplicating data.

At SeersEquities, this means **smoother handoffs, faster risk evaluation, and better cross-team alignment**. For you, it means **mastering a modern data-sharing workflow that‚Äôs secure, scalable, and built for collaboration**.
