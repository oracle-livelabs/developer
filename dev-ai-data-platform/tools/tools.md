# 🔗 Simplify Data Access and Data Sharing  with Integrated Tools

#### Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes

## Introduction

In this lab, you’ll discover the key **data platform tools** used with **Autonomous Database (ADB)** to query, manage, transform, explore, and share your data. By the end, you’ll see how these tools work together to help you easily **load data**, **organize it**, **query it**, and **share it**—without needing a deep technical background.

By leveraging the integrated data platform tools with ADB, you’ll see how easy it is to go from **accessing raw data** all the way to **collaborating with other departments** to ensure everyone has the data they need, **exactly** when they need it. 📊🤝

Enjoy the journey and get ready to unlock the full potential of the **Oracle Data Platform** and your **Oracle Autonomous Database**! 🚀

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* Completed the Get Started lab
* Successfully launched the hands-on lab environment

## Task 1: Navigate to your assigned ADB instance

## Task 2: Intro to Database Actions

**Database Actions** is a web-based interface that provides development, data, administration, and monitoring tools for Oracle Autonomous Database. It allows users to run SQL queries, manage database objects, and develop REST APIs directly from their browser without requiring additional software installation.

1. From your database instance home page, select "**Database Actions**"
