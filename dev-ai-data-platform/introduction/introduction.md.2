# Introduction

## About this Workshop 

In this workshop, we will explore how to build a cutting-edge GenAI powered loan approval application leveraging Oracle Autonomous Database and the latest Oracle Database 23ai features.  

The workshop includes developer coding challenges that will allow advanced developers to gain hands on experience enhancing a live application that incorporates the use of **Generative AI**, **AI Chatbots**, **AI Vector Search**, **RAG**, **JSON Duality views**, & **Property Graphs** to help a loan officer quickly analyze loan application requests & determine the best loan products for the customer. 

The lab solution you will build will generate data-driven insights by integrating data that is structured in various formats, from internal & external sources. By harnessing the robust capabilities of the Oracle AI Data Platform, the loan officers can streamline document processing, accelerate loan approvals, and leverage in-line generative AI to fine tune loan options in real-time, while ensuring compliance with company and regulatory compliance policies.

### Objectives

The primary goal of this workshop is to demonstrate **Oracle Database 23ai’s** capabilities in automating and enhancing the loan approval process. Through hands-on demonstrations and technical deep-dives, the workshop will guide attendees through the process of integrating Oracle 23ai features into a custom web application.  
By leveraging **AI Vector Search**, **Graph**, and **JSON/JSON DUALITY VIEWS**, this project will help participants understand how to: 

 
* Use AI Vector Search to ask questions about the applicant’s financial data. 

* Track the loan approval status and update loan applications. 

* Generate PDF reports on loan decisions. 

* Analyze applicant data using a Graph. 

* Send AI-generated emails to applicants notifying them of their approval status. 

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* An Oracle account
