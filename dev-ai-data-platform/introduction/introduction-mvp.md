# Introduction

## About this Workshop

**Data isn't just an asset—it's the lifeblood of modern enterprises.**

Imagine a mid-sized lender, SeerEquities, racing to keep pace in a world where every loan, market shift, or rule change needs reliable, and real-time data. For SeerEquities, data isn’t just stored; it fuels critical decisions, regulatory reports, and customer-facing innovations.

But as the business ran faster, its data strategy lagged. Transformed data lived in silos. ETL pipelines stalled. Teams scrambled to answer simple questions: “How many loans closed last week?”, “Which customer segment is showing early signs of default?” Time slipped away in discovery, rework, and reconciliation.

Enter Oracle Autonomous Database as a modern Data Platform. In this workshop, you’ll act as SeerEquities’ data engineer. Your mission: build and manage the data products that streamline the company’s data lifecycle—from ingestion and transformation to analytics and secure sharing.

This isn’t theory. You’ll step through real‑world scenarios:

* Respond to evolving business needs, like delivering weekly delinquency reports to executive teams.

* Discover and catalog raw loan and customer data ingested from production systems.

* Transform and cleanse data, enabling consistent dashboards and KPI analytics.

* Securely share curated data products across teams—compliance, finance, sales—while maintaining data governance.

By unifying SeerEquities’ data, you’ll see how Oracle’s platform enables data engineers to:

✅ Turn reactive requests into proactive insights  
✅ Accelerate delivery of high‑quality, consumable data products  
✅ Support effective multi‑team collaboration within a secure environment

Estimated Workshop Time: 2 hours 30 minutes


### **Objectives**

In this session, you’ll:

* Receive real-world **enhancement requests** that mimic evolving business demands

* Perform **data discovery, transformation**, and **data sharing** using Autonomous Database tools

* Apply **data governance** and quality best practices as you build trusted data products

By the end, you won’t just understand Oracle’s Data Platform—you’ll have experienced how it transforms data chaos into business-ready intelligence, helping finance organizations like SeerEquities thrive through data-driven decision-making.

### **Prerequisites**

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle account to submit your LiveLabs Sandbox reservation.

* Basic knowledge of Oracle Database.

## Key Terms

### **Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB)**

Oracle Autonomous Database lets you work with all types of data—structured, unstructured, and external—in one place. By replacing multiple specialized databases, it simplifies your data architecture and cuts down on management overhead.

You can run everything from SQL queries to machine learning, spatial analysis, or vector search across internal and external sources. With a unified platform, you get faster insights and less complexity.

### **Data Platform**

A data platform collects, stores, cleans, transforms, analyzes, and governs your organization’s data in one place. It combines hardware and software to streamline workflows. By centralizing data operations, it helps teams get faster insights, improve decisions, and run smoother operations. And with real-time access built in, today’s data platforms power smarter AI systems—fueling innovation and scaling intelligence.

### **Data Product**

A data product is a reusable data asset built to solve a business problem or deliver insights. It turns raw data into trusted, ready-to-use information that teams can access across tools, apps, and departments—even with external partners.

Each data product comes with context: metadata, lineage, and governance policies. That’s what builds trust and consistency. By treating data like a product, organizations scale sharing, speed up innovation, and make smarter decisions, faster.

### **Data Catalog**

With Data Catalog, you can collect, tag, search, and activate metadata to make sense of your data assets, improve governance, and boost how your organization uses data.

Autonomous Database, comes with a builtin Catalog Tool that allows you to browse, search and discover data in, and connected to, the Oracle Autonomous Database.

The Autonomous Database Catalog is a multi-catalog tool that provides a way to search for data and other objects in your currently connected Autonomous Database, and also in a wide range of other connected systems.

The Catalog tool enables you to search, find, load, or link connected data assets from anywhere in the cloud and beyond. It also enables you to mount new catalogs over other systems and search for data and other items in the connected Autonomous Database.

### **Data Warehouse**

A data warehouse stores structured, cleaned, and preprocessed data for business intelligence and analytics. Primarily used for business intelligence (BI) and reporting, providing historical data analysis for trends and insights.

### **Data Lake**

A data warehouse stores structured, cleaned data to support business intelligence. It powers reports and historical analysis, helping teams spot trends and draw insights.

### **Data Lakehouse**

A lakehouse combines the flexibility of a data lake with the reliability and speed of a data warehouse. It lets users shape and analyze data their way—without giving up performance. Teams use it to power machine learning, BI, and predictive analytics.
