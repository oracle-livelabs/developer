# Build your Data Pipeline: Load & Transform Data (optional lab)

## Lab Summary 

In this next lab, you’ll practice bringing in data from Oracle Object Storage and getting it ready for analysis in different formats. By the end, you’ll know how to load both CSV and JSON files, then transform them as needed for easier use. By the end of these Tasks, you’ll understand how to move CSV and JSON data from Object Storage into Oracle—no matter what format it’s in—and then transform it so it’s easy to search, share, and analyze!

## Task 1: Load CSV Data from Object Storage 

(Approved Affordable Homes Zones) 

* You’ll grab a CSV (comma-separated values) file from your Object Storage bucket—think of it like a simple spreadsheet. 

* You’ll import this data into your database, so you can easily analyze home zone data right inside Oracle. 

## Task 2: Load JSON Data from Object Storage & Transform via ETL (Loan Offers)

* Next, you’ll handle JSON files—these are more like structured text that show data in pairs of names and values. 

* You’ll run an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to clean or reformat that JSON data and get it ready for queries. 

* Once it’s loaded, you can join it with other information in your database to see loan offers in a whole new light.
