# Introduction

## About this Workshop



In this workshop, you will explore how to use SpringBoot to build microservices to build and deploy a Cloud Native application. You will serve the data to the React.js frontend and persist your data in the Oracle Autonomous database while utilizing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services.

Estimated Time: 50 minutes

### Objectives

In this 3 part workshop, you will:

* Provision a Kubernetes cluster, Oracle Autonomous Database, a Container Registry, and an API Gateway
* Understand, build, and deploy a Java tier implementing the REST APIs, using the SpringBoot framework, Docker, the OCI Container Registry, and a Kubernetes service
* Understand, build, and deploy a ReactJS frontend/UI making REST calls to the SpringBoot service implementing the REST APIs; then redeploy the ReactJS frontend over an OCI Object storage bucket

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Free Tier or Paid Cloud Account

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
