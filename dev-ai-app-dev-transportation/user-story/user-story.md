## Task 2: Demo - Approving a Shipper with a low risk Route Feasibility Rating score

In this first example, you will use the application to approve a shipper with a low risk route feasibility score. The first user on your to-do list is Diana Young from FreightMax.

1. On the Dashboard page, from the pending review list, select the review button for **Diana Young**.

    ![Select Diana Young](./images/diana-young.png =50%x*)

2. Opening Diana Young’s profile reveals her transportation load approval request details—name, email, shipper ID, request ID, and transportation status. You will also be able to see detailed AI analysis on the shipper consisting of a comprehensive evaluation, and top 3 requests with approval probability. 

    ![Diana Young AI generated recommendations](./images/diana-young-ai.png =50%x*)

3. At the bottom of Diana Young’s profile, you will find the **AI Guru**—a chatbot built on Oracle AI Database and Vector search. When prompted, the system uses **RAG** to generate a response. It converts the question and energy data into embeddings, performs a similarity search, and then uses the **GenAI service** to turn the enriched context into a clear, natural language answer. If the shipper calls with a question, you can quickly enter it into the AI Guru to generate a relevant response. 
 

    **Copy** the question below into the AI chatbot and press **Enter**. What does the AI Guru respond?

    ```text
    <copy>
    Why was this request approved?

>💡 In Oracle AI Database, **AI Vector Search** allows you to combine your business data with a Large Language Model (LLM) to reduce hallucinations and get accurate answers from your data.

4. Select the **Navigate To Shipper Decisions** button.

    ![Diana Decision](./images/diana-young-decision.png =50%x*)

    After navigating to the decisions page, the AI evaluation runs in the background. Transportation documents containing feeder information such as trailer capacity, driving hours, and route restrictions are stored in Oracle AI Database and modeled with JSON Duality Views. These documents are vectorized and searched using AI Vector Search to identify semantically relevant prior requests and compliance criteria. The results are passed to OCI Generative AI, which uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to generate a natural-language explanation, formatted for both internal review and external communication. 

5. In the **Select Your Desired Option** section, the available options are displayed. If more data is needed, the reviewer can upload documents, add missing information, and trigger a re-evaluation. The system dynamically adjusts the recommendation, and generates a decision letter sent directly to the shipper.

    ![Diana Recommendation](./images/diana-young-recommendation.png =50%x*)

6. Select the AI-recommended authorization decision. In this example, that is **Approved**. 

    >Please note that your results may vary. The information provided is generated by OCI Generative AI services, and your outcomes may differ from those presented.

    ![Diana Select Option](./images/diana-select-option.png =50%x*)

7. Set the final authorization status to **Approved**, then click **Confirm Decision** to complete the process.

    The authorization status has been updated to 'Approved' and saved to the shipper profile.

    ![Diana Young Save Status](./images/diana-save-status.png =50%x*)

8.  Click the **Download Decision as PDF** button.

    ![Diana Download Recommendation](./images/diana-young-download.png =50%x*)

9.  Click **Download PDF**

    ![Diana Young Download PDF](./images/diana-download-pdf.png =50%x*)

10. Display the message the shipper would see by opening the downloaded PDF.

    ![Open Diana Young PDF](./images/open-diana-pdf.png =50%x*)

11. Click the **Return to Dashboard** button to navigate back to the Dashboard. Expand **View Approved Shippers**. We can see that Diana Young has been removed from the Pending Shippers list and has been added to the Approved Shippers list.

    ![Diana Young Approved List](./images/diana-approved-list.png =50%x*)

**Task Summary**

Once you select and save one of the 3 desired options recommended by the AI: 

✅ The shipper's load approval request is updated.

✅ A finalized PDF decision document is generated.  

✅ The dashboard reflects the change in real-time — marking Diana as Approved.

Congratulations, you have just approved your first shipper load! Proceed to the next task.

## Task 3: Demo - Deny a shipper request
In this example, you will navigate the application to review a customer and deny them as part of the exercise. The next user on your to-do list is George Baker.

1. On the Dashboard page, from the pending review list, select the review button for **George Baker**.

    ![Select George Baker](./images/george-baker.png =50%x*)

2. Opening George Baker’s profile displays his shipper history details. Within a few seconds, the AI automatically generates a suggested action. In this case, the system evaluates the profile and assigns it to “high risk” with explanations outlining key risk factors.

    This shipper has: 

    * A route with a **road closure**
    * A route with **a trip duration that exceeds their hours of service**
    * A route with  **significant traffic delays**

    The AI evaluates the profile and suggests next steps. In this case, it recommends denying the request and also provides clear explanations on why the recommendation is to deny the request.

    ![George Baker AI generated recommendations](./images/george-baker-ai.png =50%x*)

3. Select the **Navigate to Shipper Decisions** button.

    ![George Baker Decision](./images/george-baker-decision.png =50%x*)

>⁉️ **What are two reasons that the AI denied this request?** 

4. Expand **Interactive Graph: Shipment Requests & Routing** to view the graph.

    ![George Baker Graph](./images/expand-graph.png =50%x*)

    On the decision page, the load approval coordinator can use **Interactive Graph: Shipment Request & Routing** to explore route paths in load approval scenarios. Built with **Oracle Graph**, this feature visually maps decisions and highlights important features of the request like the route analysis and compliance rules.

    ![George Baker Graph](./images/george-baker-graph.png =50%x*)

>💡 In Oracle AI Database, **Property Graph** allows you to treat your data like a network of connected points, where each point (called a node) and each link (called an edge) has its own details or properties. This setup helps you run graph analytics, to find important connections or patterns, directly within the database.


5. On the decisions page you can view the AI recommendation for George Baker. It shows the suggested action, comprehensive evaluation, and recommendations explanations. 

    ![George Baker recommendations](./images/george-baker-save.png =50%x*)

6. The authorization status is set to **Request Info**. Click the dropdown and select **Denied**, then select **Confirm Decision** button.

    The authorization status has been updated to 'Denied' and saved to the shipper profile.

    ![George Baker Save Status](./images/george-baker-confirm.png =50%x*)

7. Press the **Download Decision PDF** button to save the AI responses and proceed to the final authorization disposition.

    ![George Baker PDF](./images/george-baker-pdf.png =50%x*)

8. Click the **Download PDF** button.

    ![George Download Recommendation](./images/george-download.png =50%x*)

9. Display the message the shipper would see by opening the downloaded PDF.

    ![Open George PDF](./images/open-george-pdf.png =50%x*)

10. Click the **Return to Dashboard** button to navigate back to the Dashboard. Expand **View Denied Shipper**. You will see that George Baker has been moved from the **Pending Shpippers** list to the **Denied Shippers** list.

    ![George Denied List](./images/george-denied-list.png =50%x*)

**Task Summary**

Congratulations, you have finished reviewing a shipper that requires study! Proceed to the next task.

## Task 4: Demo - Update shipper details

Lastly, let’s explore how the system uses JSON Duality Views to handle profile updates. In this task, you will edit a shipper's details. In this example, the shipper was asked to submit documentation on the shipment.

1. On the Dashboard page, from the **Pending Shippers** list, select the review button for **Evan Scott**.

    ![Select Evan](./images/evan-scott.png =50%x*)

2. We will upload a document to update the shipment information. On the Shipper Details page, click the **Upload Document** button. The PDF file has been loaded. Then click the **Process PDF** button

    ![Upload Document](./images/upload-document.png =50%x*)

>💡 **JSON Duality Views** let's you update unstructured data in an easy, high-level format while automatically handling the technical details behind the scenes. This makes it faster and simpler to work with messy data and connect it to structured systems.

4. The shipper profile has been updated.

    ![Customer Profile Updated](./images/profile-updated.png)

**Task Summary**

Once the document is uploaded:

✅ The system automatically detects the new compliance data.

✅ The profile will be updated with compliance documentation.

✅ Thanks to JSON Transform and JSON Duality Views, only the relevant field is modified — leaving the rest of the profile UNTOUCHED.

## Conclusion
