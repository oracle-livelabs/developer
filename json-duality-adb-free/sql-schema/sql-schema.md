# Create the schema including JSON Duality Views

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to log into SQL Developer, create tables and JSON duality views needed to execute the rest of this workshop. Then you will populate the views and tables.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Login as SQL Developer User
* Create the JSON Duality Views and base tables needed
* Populate your database

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* Access to OCI console
* Oracle Autonomous Database 23ai Free Tier instance

## Task 1: Preparing your database user

1. Upon launching your workshop, on your upper left hand side, you'll see **View Login Info**. Click this to begin.

    ![Login info ](images/login-info.png " ")

2. From here, click **Copy value** on the bottom of the screen to copy the User password. Note: you'll want to verify that the password was correctly copied, if not, manually copy it. Next, click on the **SQL Web Developer URL**, this will take us to the login menu. 

    ![Areas to select](images/reservation-info.png " ")

3. At the login menu, click **Advanced** and enter the following: 
    - PATH: **HOL23AI** (case sensitive). 
    - Username: **hol23ai**. 
    - Password: Paste value from step 2.

   Once all 3 values have been entered, click **Sign in**.
   ![All sing-in info](images/hol23ai-sign-in.png " ")

4. Once signed in, click SQL worksheet. This is where our work will be prefomed. Click **SQL** worksheet button under Development. If you are signed out, you can go back to this section by clicking on **Development**.

## Task 2: Creating your database tables and JSON duality views

1. When accessing the SQL for the first time, you'll be given a quick tour of the console. This will explain what the different sections and icons in the console are used for. Feel free to hit Next and read the description or just hit the X to close the tour. 

    ![The tour walkthrough](images/tour.png " ")

2. As you go through this workshop, we will specify whether to to use the Run button or Run Script button to run our statements. The Run button runs just one SQL Statement and formats the output into a data grid. The Run Script button runs many SQL statements and spools their output. We will highlight which to use.

   ![Selecting Run or Run Script](images/run-sql-script.png " ")

3. We will create a set of tables that model a Formula 1 racing scenario. The tables are: 
    - Teams table: table for the teams, consist of `team_id`, `name` and `points`.
    - Drivers table: Individual drivers. Consists of `driver_id`, `name`, and `points`. Also references the team they belong to, `team_id`.
    - Race table: Table for individual races. Consists of `race_id`, `name`, `laps`, `race_date` and a JSON object to store the podium finishers `podium`.
    - Driver-Race Mapping: Captures the drivers performance for the races.Connects drivers to races. Consists of `drvier_race_map_id`, `position` to record where a driver finishes in each race. Uses foreign keys `race_id` and `driver_id`.

    
    Copy the code below and run it in the worksheet by clicking the **Run Script** button.


    ```
    <copy>

    DROP VIEW IF EXISTS team_dv;
    DROP VIEW IF EXISTS race_dv;
    DROP VIEW IF EXISTS driver_dv;
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS driver_race_map;
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS race;
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS driver;
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS team;

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS team
    (team_id INTEGER GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY,
    name    VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    points  INTEGER NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT team_pk PRIMARY KEY(team_id));

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS driver
    (driver_id INTEGER GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY,
    name      VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    points    INTEGER NOT NULL,
    team_id   INTEGER,
    CONSTRAINT driver_pk PRIMARY KEY(driver_id),
    CONSTRAINT driver_fk FOREIGN KEY(team_id) REFERENCES team(team_id));

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS race
    (race_id   INTEGER GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY,
    name      VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    laps      INTEGER NOT NULL,
    race_date DATE,
    podium  JSON,
    CONSTRAINT   race_pk PRIMARY KEY(race_id));

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS driver_race_map
    (driver_race_map_id INTEGER GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY,
    race_id            INTEGER NOT NULL,
    driver_id          INTEGER NOT NULL,
    position           INTEGER,
    CONSTRAINT driver_race_map_pk  PRIMARY KEY(driver_race_map_id),
    CONSTRAINT driver_race_map_fk1 FOREIGN KEY(race_id) REFERENCES race(race_id),
    CONSTRAINT driver_race_map_fk2 FOREIGN KEY(driver_id) REFERENCES driver(driver_id));

    </copy>
    ```

    ![Creates the drive id](images/create-tables.png " ")

4. Next, will create a database trigger on the driver\_race\_map table to automatically update the points for both drivers and their respective team whenever a new race result is inserted in the `driver_race_map` table. Click the trash to clear the worksheet and paste the code below. Once you've pasted the code into the worksheet, click **Run Script**.

    ```
    <copy>

    CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER driver_race_map_trigger
    BEFORE INSERT ON driver_race_map
    FOR EACH ROW
    DECLARE
        v_points  INTEGER;
        v_team_id INTEGER;
    BEGIN
    SELECT team_id INTO v_team_id FROM driver WHERE driver_id = :NEW.driver_id;
    IF :NEW.position = 1 THEN
        v_points := 25;
    ELSIF :NEW.position = 2 THEN
        v_points := 18;
    ELSIF :NEW.position = 3 THEN
        v_points := 15;
    ELSIF :NEW.position = 4 THEN
        v_points := 12;
    ELSIF :NEW.position = 5 THEN
        v_points := 10;
    ELSIF :NEW.position = 6 THEN
        v_points := 8;
    ELSIF :NEW.position = 7 THEN
        v_points := 6;
    ELSIF :NEW.position = 8 THEN
        v_points := 4;
    ELSIF :NEW.position = 9 THEN
        v_points := 2;
    ELSIF :NEW.position = 10 THEN
        v_points := 1;
    ELSE
        v_points := 0;
    END IF;
    UPDATE driver SET points = points + v_points
        WHERE driver_id = :NEW.driver_id;
    UPDATE team SET points = points + v_points
        WHERE team_id = v_team_id;
    END;
    /

    </copy>
    ```

    ![Creates team id and output](images/create-trigger.png " ")

5. We will now create the JSON Relational Duality view called `race_dv` duality view. Notice that we only allow updates on the driver table but insert update delete onto race and driver\_race\_map. You have the ability to control the interaction at the table level within your view. In the next step you will create a duality view to create and delete drivers. Click the trash to clear the worksheet, then copy the code below and paste it into the SQL Developer. Now click **Run Script**.

    ```
    <copy>
    CREATE OR REPLACE JSON RELATIONAL DUALITY VIEW race_dv AS
    SELECT JSON {
                '_id' IS r.race_id,
                'name'   IS r.name,
                'laps'   IS r.laps WITH NOUPDATE,
                'date'   IS r.race_date,
                'podium' IS r.podium WITH NOCHECK,
                'result' IS
                    [ SELECT JSON {'driverRaceMapId' IS drm.driver_race_map_id,
                                    'position'        IS drm.position,
                                    UNNEST
                                    (SELECT JSON {'driverId' IS d.driver_id,
                                                    'name'     IS d.name}
                                        FROM driver d WITH NOINSERT UPDATE NODELETE
                                        WHERE d.driver_id = drm.driver_id)}
                        FROM driver_race_map drm WITH INSERT UPDATE DELETE
                        WHERE drm.race_id = r.race_id ]}
        FROM race r WITH INSERT UPDATE DELETE;
		</copy>
    ```

	![Creates the race id](images/create-race-dv.png " ")

6. We will now be creating the next duality view named `driver_dv`. Since this is for drivers, we need strict rules on how related team and race data can be modified. To do this we will set those to NOINSERT, NOUPDATE, NODELETE so that no teams or races are created. They can also update or insert a driver's race map but not remove them. Click the trash to clear the worksheet, copy the code below and click **Run Script**.

	```
	<copy>
    CREATE OR REPLACE JSON RELATIONAL DUALITY VIEW driver_dv AS
    SELECT JSON {'_id' IS d.driver_id,
            'name'     IS d.name,
            'points'   IS d.points,
            UNNEST
                (SELECT JSON {'teamId' IS t.team_id,
                            'team'   IS t.name WITH NOCHECK}
                    FROM team t WITH NOINSERT NOUPDATE NODELETE
                    WHERE t.team_id = d.team_id),
            'race'     IS
                [ SELECT JSON {'driverRaceMapId' IS drm.driver_race_map_id,
                                UNNEST
                                (SELECT JSON {'raceId' IS r.race_id,
                                                'name'   IS r.name}
                                    FROM race r WITH NOINSERT NOUPDATE NODELETE
                                    WHERE r.race_id = drm.race_id),
                                'finalPosition'   IS drm.position}
                    FROM driver_race_map drm WITH INSERT UPDATE NODELETE
                    WHERE drm.driver_id = d.driver_id ]}
    FROM driver d WITH INSERT UPDATE DELETE;
	</copy>
    ```
    ![Creates the driver dv](images/create-driver-dv.png " ")

7. The last duality view is `teams_dv`. This view combines data from the team and driver table. When we create or make changes to team data, we can also insert and update driver data associcated with each team. Click the trash to clear the worksheet, copy the code below and click **Run Script**.

	```
	<copy>  
    CREATE OR REPLACE JSON RELATIONAL DUALITY VIEW team_dv AS
    SELECT JSON {'_id'  IS t.team_id,
                'name'    IS t.name,
                'points'  IS t.points,
                'driver'  IS
                    [ SELECT JSON {'driverId' IS d.driver_id,
                                    'name'     IS d.name,
                                    'points'   IS d.points WITH NOCHECK}
                        FROM driver d WITH INSERT UPDATE
                        WHERE d.team_id = t.team_id ]}
        FROM team t WITH INSERT UPDATE DELETE;

    </copy>
    ```
	![Creates the team dv](images/create-team-dv.png " ")

## Task 3: Populating the database
1. We are now inserting a collection of team documents into the `team_dv` duality view. Since `team_dv` is structured to manage teams and their associated drivers, we can insert data directly into both `team` and `driver` tables simultaneously. It also allows inserts into both tables. Click the trash to clear the worksheet, copy the code below and click **Run Script**.

    ```
    <copy>
    INSERT INTO team_dv VALUES ('{"_id" : 301,
                            "name"   : "Red Bull",
                            "points" : 0,
                            "driver" : [ {"driverId" : 101,
                                            "name"     : "Max Verstappen",
                                            "points"   : 0},
                                        {"driverId" : 102,
                                            "name"     : "Sergio Perez",
                                            "points"   : 0} ]}');

    INSERT INTO team_dv VALUES ('{"_id" : 302,
                                "name"   : "Ferrari",
                                "points" : 0,
                                "driver" : [ {"driverId" : 103,
                                                "name"     : "Charles Leclerc",
                                                "points"   : 0},
                                            {"driverId" : 104,
                                                "name"     : "Carlos Sainz Jr",
                                                "points"   : 0} ]}');

    INSERT INTO team_dv VALUES ('{"_id" : 2,
                                "name"   : "Mercedes",
                                "points" : 0,
                                "driver" : [ {"driverId" : 105,
                                                "name"     : "George Russell",
                                                "points"   : 0},
                                            {"driverId" : 106,
                                                "name"     : "Lewis Hamilton",
                                                "points"   : 0} ]}');
    COMMIT;
	</copy>
	```
	![Inserts teams dv](images/insert-team-dv.png " ")

2. Additionally, we are now inserting a collection of race documents into `race_dv` duality view. This automatically populates the race table. Click the trash to clear the worksheet, copy the code below and click **Run Script**.

	```
    <copy>
    INSERT INTO race_dv VALUES ('{"_id" : 201,
                                "name"   : "Bahrain Grand Prix",
                                "laps"   : 57,
                                "date"   : "2022-03-20T00:00:00",
                                "podium" : {}}');

    INSERT INTO race_dv VALUES ('{"_id" : 202,
                                "name"   : "Saudi Arabian Grand Prix",
                                "laps"   : 50,
                                "date"   : "2022-03-27T00:00:00",
                                "podium" : {}}');

    INSERT INTO race_dv VALUES ('{"_id" : 203,
                                "name"   : "Australian Grand Prix",
                                "laps"   : 58,
                                "date"   : "2022-04-09T00:00:00",
                                "podium" : {}}');
    COMMIT;
    </copy>
    ```

3. Populating a duality view automatically updates data shown in related duality views, by updating their underlying tables.

    For example, in the previous step, documents were inserted into the team\_dv duality view. This duality view joins the team table with the driver table. Once we insert into this duality view, both the team table as well as the driver table are populated.

    If you now list the contents of the driver\_dv duality view, which is based on the driver table, it has documents as well. Click the trash to clear the worksheet, copy the code below and click **Run Script**.

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT json_serialize(data PRETTY) FROM driver_dv;
    SELECT json_serialize(data PRETTY) FROM race_dv;
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Prints out the driver and race dv](images/print-driver-race.png " ")

    Your setup is now complete.

You may **proceed to the next lab.**
