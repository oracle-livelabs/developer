# Introduction

## About this Workshop


Project Panama is an OpenJDK project whose goal is to improve and enrich the connections between the Java Virtual Machine and well-defined but “foreign” (non-Java) APIs, including many interfaces commonly used by C programmers. In a nutshell, Panama eases the interaction between Java code and native code, in both ways.

Project Panama also tackles Single Instruction Mulitple Data programming in Java. SIMD is a programming technique that leverages Vector Units embedded in CPUs to produce more performant code. 

In practice, there are, in Java 19, 2 APIs that are developed under the Panama umbrella:
- the Foreign Function & Memory API (Preview)
- the Vector API (Fourth Incubator)

Moreover, jextract is a tool also developed under the same umbrella.

The goal of this workshop is to introduce you to Project Panama's Foreign Function & Memory API and the jextract tool. 

Estimated Workshop Time: 75~80 minutes
