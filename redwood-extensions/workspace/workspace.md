# Create a New Extension

## Introduction

Starting in Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications, we'll navigate to Visual Builder Studio and create a new workspace where we can develop our extension.

Estimated Lab Time: 5 minutes

### About Oracle Visual Builder Studio
Oracle Visual Builder Studio (which we'll call "VB Studio" from now on) is included as one of the configuration tools that come with Oracle Fusion Cloud Apps. We'll use VB Studio to create and manage a project where we develop extensions.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Access VB Studio
* Create a project
* Create a new workspace


## Task 1: Access Visual Builder Studio and Create a Project

Users with [the right roles](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/visual-builder/visualbuilder-administration/set-vb-studio-extend-oracle-cloud-applications.html#GUID-DF0D4F76-D26A-46B5-B8E5-68D7FDD1E475) can access VB Studio from their Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications' TEST instance.

1. Log in to Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications:

2. In the hamburger menu at the top left, navigate to the **Configuration** section and expand it. Select the **Visual Builder** option (in this case, synonymous with "Visual Builder Studio"):

  ![Main menu](images/menu.png)

3. On the Organization page, if you don't already have a project click the **Create** button to create a new project.

  ![Projects](images/projects.png)

	VB Studio uses *projects* to manage individual development teams' activities.

4. In the New Project dialog provide a name for the project and keep the default setting of Private project, then click **Next**.

5. In the second step we choose a project template, we are going to use the **Empty Project** template, then click **Next**.

6. In the third step you choose a syntax for the project's wiki, we can keep the default value and then click **Next**.

7. In the fourth step you choose team members for the project, we can keep the default values and then click **Finish**.

8. Visual Builder Studio will now create the project, this may take a minute or two to complete.

9. When the creation finishes you'll be taken to the project home page.

## Task 2: Define an Environment

Environments consist of servers into which your extension will be deployed. Specifically for Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications Extensions we need to point to an instance of Oracle Fusion Cloud Application.

1. Click the **Create Environment** button in the Environments section, and provide the name **Development**.

	![Create Environment](images/createenvironment.png)

2. In the Environments page, click the **Add Instance** button to add a new server instance to our environment.

	![Add server](images/addserver.png)

3. In the Instance Type switch to look for **Oracle Cloud Applications**, this will tell VB Studio to look up for the Fusion Cloud App instance in your tenancy. Once it is located check the checkbox next to it. Then press the **Add** button to add this instance to your environment.

	![Add Instance](images/addinstance.png)

4. Once the instance has been added you'll go back to the project home page. You are now ready to create a new app extension on this new instance.

Make sure the environment has a green checkmark indicating it is available to use.

## Task 3: Create a Workspace
You are on the project's home page

From here you can navigate to all your project's components, including environments, Git repositories, CI/CD pipelines, issue tracking system, wikis, and much more. In this lab, we'll focus only on workspaces. A *workspace* is a private area where you can develop your extension. Among other things, the workspace defines your Git repository, your Oracle Fusion Cloud Application environment, and other important details.

1. Click **Workspaces** in the left navigation menu:

	![workspaces](images/workspace.png)

2. Click **New**, then select **New Application Extension** to create a new workspace for your extension:

	![new workspace](images/newworkspace.png)

3. In the New Application Extension dialog, populate the fields with these values:
| Field | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extension Name | YourName-Accounts | To keep the names distinct, use your first name plus the first initial of your last name, as in *MaryC-Accounts* |
| Development Environment |Choose the option available | Mapped to your SaaS instance|
| Base Oracle Cloud Application | None | Not needed in this scenario |
| Sandbox | No sandbox selected | Not needed in this scenario |
| Use scratch repository | Check | For now, you can just work in a private Git repository |
{: title="New App Extension Properties"}

4. Click **Create**.  It may take a couple of minutes to create your workspace.  When VB Studio is finished, you'll be taken into the Designer, where you can get to work:

## Task 4: Install Components

VB has some of the most commonly used components pre-installed.  Other components are available in the Component Exchange.  In this lab you will be installing the Redwood components you will need for the extension.

* Collection Container
* Horizontal Foldout Layout Page Template
* Summarizing Foldout Panel
* Simple Create and Edit Page Template (There are two in the list, choose the **oj-sp-simple-create-edit-pattern** component)
* Welcome Page Template

1. On the far left side of the Designer's navigator, click the fifth tab, Components:
Clicking the name of components in the list will open a details page for that component.
![Edit values](images/opencomponentstab.png)
2. Click the Installed tab and check if the five Redwood components listed at the start of this task are already installed in your app, if they are you can skip the following steps and continue to the next lab:
![Edit values](images/installedcomponents.png)
3. If any of the above components are not installed, click the Browse tab:

Install the **Collection Container** component.
1. In the **Search** field, enter **Collection Container**:
![Edit values](images/collectioncontainersearchresults.png)
2. If the button under **Collection Container** says **Install**, click the button.  If it says **Installed**, proceed to the next component:
3. In the popup window, check the box to accept the license and click the **Install** button:
![Edit values](images/installcollectioncontainer.png)

Repeat this process for each of the components.  Some of the components have names similar to other components not used in this lab.  Double check that you are installing the correct component.

Once you have all of the components installed, you may **proceed to the next lab**.
