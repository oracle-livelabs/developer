# Introduction to LiveLabs Workshop Workflow

## LiveLabs Workshop Workflow

Before you start, please check LiveLabs ([developer.oracle.com/livelabs](https://developer.oracle.com/livelabs)) to see if there is already a workshop similar to the content you want to create. Please also check WMS to see if there is already a workshop in development that resembles your content. If so, please contact that workshop team to see if you can cooperate on the workshop. If not, please proceed.

In order for a workshop to go from an idea to a LiveLabs workshop in production, it has to go through the following phases or statuses in WMS. You can refer to this section to see your current and next steps.

1. After workshop team submits the workshop request (see details in Lab 1 -> Task 1), the workshop is in *Submitted* status. The workshop's *council* group will review the workshop within 2-3 business days. Council will either approve the workshop and move it to *Approved*, or ask the workshop team for more information and move it to *More Info Needed*.

> **Note:** If workshop teams have not heard back from council for more than 3 business days, please follow up with your council group. To find your council members, go to WMS, under **People & Role Reports**, select **Workshop Council Members**, and you can find your council members.

1. Council asks workshop team for *more information*. Workshop team will respond to council via the **Message the Team** tab in WMS to get the workshop approved.

4. Workshop team will move the workshop to *In Development* when they start workshop development. Workshop team can refer to Lab 1 to Lab 4 to see workshop development related instructions.

5. After development, workshop team will move the workshop status to *Self QA*. Follow Lab 4 -> Task 8 to self QA the workshop. After Self QA, workshop team will move the workshop status to *Self QA Complete* and send the completed Self QA form to the stakeholders.

  Workshop authors can watch the video below on how to self QA your workshop. Stakeholders can also watch the video below to learn how to verify the QA of a workshop.

6. The workshop's *stakeholder* will verify the QA within 2 business days. They will either send workshop team issues to fix, or move the workshop to *Completed* status, meaning the workshop is ready for production.

7. The workshop is *completed* and is ready for publishing! Workshop teams will submit a publishing request, and LiveLabs team will approve it. After the publishing request is approved, the workshop will be live in LiveLabs automatically within a business day.
