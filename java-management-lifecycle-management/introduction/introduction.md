# Introduction

## About Java Runtime Lifecycle Management

Lifecycle Management (LCM) is a part of JMS's reporting and management infrastructure. JMS enables users to observe and manage the lifecycles of their Java SE runtimes (on-premises or in the Cloud) by performing LCM operations such as installing or removing Java Runtimes.

As a customer, you can:
  * View and identify the Java Runtimes.
  * Install Java Runtimes.
  * Remove unwanted Java Runtimes.
  * View and understand various status and logs of LCM work requests.

## About this Workshop

Java Management Service (JMS) is a reporting and management infrastructure integrated with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Platform services to observe and manage your use of Java SE (on-premises or in the Cloud). Java Runtime can be viewed and identified in fleet after successful JMS setup on Managed Instances. Further, these Java Runtimes can be managed by performing various Lifecycle Management (LCM) operations.

In order to perform these LCM operations almost no or minor configuration changes are required. This workshop will walk you through the steps to enable LCM operations in OCI and non-OCI Managed Instances. Next, you will learn how to install and remove a Java Runtime using OCI console. You will also get to verify the status of the work requests. Finally, the workshop will show you how to view and monitor Lifecycle Management requests.

_Estimated Time:_ 80 minutes
