# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Generative AI agents are powerful for reasoning and decision-making, but to be truly useful in enterprise scenarios, they need access to real-world tools and data. This is where the Model Context Protocol (MCP) comes in. MCP allows developers to expose services—such as APIs or business logic—as tools that an agent can call in real time.
In this hands-on LiveLab, we’ll show how to integrate an MCP server with OCI Generative AI Agents, using a simple weather server as an example. By the end, you’ll understand how to extend your OCI agents with domain-specific tools, accelerating automation and enhancing business outcomes.

Estimated Workshop Time: 2 hours


### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:
* Set up a Python environment and deploy a local MCP server with custom tools
* Create and configure an OCI Generative AI agent
* Integrate the MCP server as a toolkit for the OCI GenAI agent
* Test the agent-tool integration with sample queries

### Prerequisites (Optional)

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account with access to Generative AI services and permissions to create/manage agents
* OCI API key configured (with a DEFAULT profile in ~/.oci/config and corresponding private key)
* Python 3.10 or higher installed on your local machine
* A virtual environment tool (e.g., venv) for Python dependency management
* Git (for cloning the workshop repository)
* Basic familiarity with Python programming and command-line interfaces
