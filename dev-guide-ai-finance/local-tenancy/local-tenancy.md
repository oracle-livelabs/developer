7. Configure the database:

   **Choose database version** - Select a database version from the available versions.<br><br>
   **Compute auto scaling** - Enable this option.

   ![Configure the database](./images/configure-db.png " ")
8. Create administrator credentials. **We will need the DB Username and Password for our .env file later. Take note of these credentials.** 

   **Password** and **Confirm Password** - Specify the password for ADMIN user of the service instance. The password must meet the following requirements:<br><br>
   1) The password must be between 12 and 30 characters long and must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one numeric character.<br><br>
   2) The password cannot contain the username.<br><br>
   3) The password cannot contain the double quote (") character.<br><br>
   4) The password must be different from the last 4 passwords used.<br><br>
   5) The password must not be the same password that is set less than 24 hours ago.<br><br>
   6) Re-enter the password to confirm it. Make a note of this password.

   ![Set administrator credentials](./images/create-admin.png " ")

9. Choose network access:

   For this lab, accept the default, **Secure access from everywhere**.<br><br>
   If you want to allow traffic only from the IP addresses and VCNs you specify where access to the database from all public IPs or VCNs is blocked, select **Secure access from allowed IPs and VCNs only**.<br><br>
   If you want to restrict access to a private endpoint within an OCI VCN, select **Private endpoint access only**.<br><br>
   If the **Require mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication** option is selected, mTLS will be required to authenticate connections to your Autonomous Database. TLS connections allows Oracle Data Provider for .NET to connect to your Autonomous Database without a wallet. See the [documentation for network options](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/adbsa/support-tls-mtls-authentication.html#GUID-3F3F1FA4-DD7D-4211-A1D3-A74ED35C0AF5) for options to allow TLS, or to require only mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the setup, here are a few common troubleshooting tips: 

* **Missing Keys or Permissions**: Double-check your .oci/config for typos and ensure the key file path is correct and readable. 

* **OCI SDK Errors**: Ensure the required OCI Python SDK is installed: 

    ````
        <copy>
        pip install oci
        </copy
    ````  

* **GenAI Access Issues**: Verify your user/group has the correct IAM policy applied. 

* **Virtual Environment Not Activating**: Ensure that you're using the correct command for your operating system. If the issue persists, try recreating the virtual environment. 

* **Dependencies Installation Issues**: Double-check theâ€¯requirements.txtâ€¯file to ensure it contains the correct package names. If a specific package fails, you can try installing it manually withâ€¯pip install <package-name>. 

* **Database Connection Errors**: Ensure that the database credentials in theâ€¯.envâ€¯file are correct and that you have access to the Autonomous Database. 

## Additional Notes
* Your .oci/config and .environment files contain sensitive credentials. Do not commit them to version control. 

* Keep your oci\_api\_key.pem secure and never share it. 

* If you use multiple OCI profiles, you can add them to ~/.oci/config and reference them explicitly in your code. 

* This setup is intended for development and local testing purposes. If you're looking to deploy the application in production, additional configurations may be required. 

* Ensure that your system's Python version is compatible (3.9 or higher) and that the virtual environment is activated whenever you work on the application. 

## Conclusion
By following the steps outlined above, you should be able to set up and run the application locally. If you face any issues, refer to the troubleshooting section or contact the support team for assistance. 

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
