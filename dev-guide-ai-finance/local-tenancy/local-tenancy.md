# How-to Install and Run the Application on OCI

## Introduction

This lab will show you how to setup and run the Seer Equities Loan Approval application on OCI. This guide is designed to walk you through the complete setup process, which includes provisioning required services and installing dependencies enabling you to launch and run the application on OCI.

The document is structured to help you meet all prerequisites, configure both the Autonomous Database and the OCI Generative AI Service, and troubleshoot any issues that may arise during setup. Whether you're new to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure or simply deploying for development and testing, this step-by-step guide will ensure a smooth setup experience.

Estimated Time: 60 minutes

### Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Provision and connect to an OCI VM and an Oracle Autonomous Database.

- Set up a Python-based local development environment.

- Configure access to OCI Generative AI services.

- Securely store your credentials and configuration details.

- Launch and interact with the application using Streamlit.

>   ðŸ’¡Note: This guide is intended for development and testing purposes. For production deployment, additional configuration and security hardening will be required.

Letâ€™s get started!

## Task 1: Create a virtual cloud network and a compute instance

1. Click the Navigation menu in the top left and select **Compute** then **Instances**.

    ![Compute Instance](./images/select-compute.png " ")

2. Verify that the filter reflects the correct compartment and click **Create Instance**.

    ![Create instance button](./images/click-create-instance.png " ")

3. Name the instance **SeerVM**, verify you're in the correct compartment, and accept all the defaults. Click the **Next** button.

    > **Note**: While all operating systems are supported, we recommend using Oracle Linux 9 as the operating system. The application runs on any available shape, including shapes available in the OCI Always Free tier.

    ![Create Compute Instance](./images/create-instance-2.png " ")

4. On the Security screen, click **Next**.

5. In the **Networking** section name the VNIC - *SeerVNIC*. Check the radio button to **Create new virtual cloud network**. Verify that the radio button for **Create new public subnet** is checked.

    ![Select VNIC](./images/name-vnic-confirm.png " ")

    In the **Add SSH Keys** section, you can generate a new SSH key pair or use your favorite existing keys.

6. To generate a new key pair, click the radio button next to **Generate a key pair for me**. Then click the **Download private key** button to save the file to your local downloads directory. Click the button to **Download public key** to your local computer so you have both keys for safe-keeping.

    ![Generate public SSH keys](./images/generate-public-keys.png " ")

    In a future task you'll need the SSH keys to gain access to the compute instance where you'll configure and run the software for this lab. Feel free to move the SSH keys to the .ssh directory of your terminal application. This will vary depending on which terminal emulator you're using on your system.

7. You can also utilize an existing key pair if you already have one. Choose the radio button for **Upload public key file (.pub)** and drop the file on the box or click it to locate the file and upload it to the VM.

    ![Upload public SSH keys](./images/upload-public-keys.png " ")

8. Alternately, you can paste the contents of an existing public key. Locate the key you want to use and open it up in an editor. Copy and paste the contents of the key into the field

    ![Paste public SSH keys](./images/paste-ssh-key.png " ")

9. Once you've completed the SSH Key section, click the **Next** button to continue.

10. On the Boot Volume section, accept the defaults and choose **Next**.

11. Review the VM configuration information. Look in the Networking section and verify that **Public IPv4 address** = **Yes**. Click the **Create** button.

    ![Review the basic VM information](./images/review-basic-information.png " ")
    
12. The instance will begin provisioning and in a few moments the state will change to **Succeeded** and then to **Running**.

   ![Compute Instance success](./images/create-instance-succeeded.png " ")

In the next step, you'll add 5 ingress rules to allow traffic on specific ports within your VCN.

13. Click on the **Navigation Menu** and select **Networking** then **Virtual Cloud Networks**.

![Select VCN](./images/select-vcn.png " ")

14. Click the VCN link that was created along with your compute instance.

15. Click the **Security** tab, then click on the **Default Security List for vcn-xxxxx**.

![Select VCN](./images/click-default-security-list.png " ")

16. Click the **Security Rules** tab, then click the **Add Ingress Rules** under the Ingress Rules section. Note that port 22 is already enabled for SSH communication.

    ![Click Add Ingress Rules](./images/click-add-ingress-rules.png " ")

17. For each rule, add 0.0.0.0/0 as the **Source CIDR** and add the specific port below to the **Destination Port Range** field. Click **+ Another Ingress Rule** after each entry.

Add 5 rules using the below information. 

| Ingress Rule #  | Source CIDR | Port # |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| 1  | 0.0.0.0/0  | 80    |
| 2  | 0.0.0.0/0  | 1521    |
| 3  | 0.0.0.0/0  | 1522    |
| 4  | 0.0.0.0/0  | 8501    |
| 5  | 0.0.0.0/0  | 8502    |
    {: title="Ingress rules"}


When you've added all 5 ingress rules, click the **Add Ingress Rules** button at the bottom right of the page.

 ![Add Ingress Rules](./images/add-ingress-rules-all.png " ")

3. Once the state changes to **Available**, the Autonomous Transaction Processing database is ready to use!

    ![Provisioning an Autonomous Database instance](./images/atp-detail-review.png " ")

## Task 5: Setting up the Local Environment

The application environment has been created and zipped up for you in a downloadable package.

1. Return to the terminal connected to the VM. From the /home/opc directory, enter the following command in your terminal to download the application package to your virtual machine.

```
    <copy>
    wget https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/database/ai-app-build-local.zip
    </copy>
```

2. Unzip the file.

```
    <copy>
    unzip ai-app-build.zip
    </copy>
```

Next we're going to generate an oci configuration file that will contain user credentials and other settings needed for interacting with Oracle Cloud. In order to prepare for this step you'll need to gather the user OCID, the tenancy OCID, and the tenancy region and store these in a text file.

3. User OCID:  Click the profile icon in the upper right corner of the OCI console and choose **User settings**.

    ![User settings](./images/click-user-settings.png " ")

4. In the My profile screen, locate the **OCID** field and click **Copy** to the right of the OCID field. Store this information in a text file.

    ![User OCID](./images/user-ocid.png " ")
 
5. Tenancy OCID: Click the profile icon in the upper right corner of the OCI console and choose **Tenancy:*your tenancy name***

   ![User OCID](./images/your-tenancy-name.png " ")

6. Locate the tenancy OCID and click the **Copy** button to copy the OCID. Paste it into your text file.

   ![User OCID](./images/your-tenancy-name-2.png " ")

7. Identify the home region of your tenancy located on the top bar of the console toward the right. Note that information in your text file.

   ![User OCID](./images/region.png " ")

8. With the above information handy, run the following command in the terminal.

```
    <copy>
    oci setup config
    </copy>
```
9. Hit return to accept the default config file location of /home/opc/.oci/config

10. Enter your user OCID, tenancy OCID, and select your region from the list by using the corresponding number.

11. When asked if you want to generate a new API key, answer 'Y' for yes.

12. Press **Enter** to accept the default creation directory of /home/opc/.oci

13. Press **Enter** to accept the default name of *oci_api_key*.

14. Enter *N/A* twice to eliminate the need for a passphrase. (Your output won't show up in the terminal screen.)

Next you'll create an environment file for the application.

15. An environment file template has been included in the zip file and is available to make editing easier. The file is named '.env.template' Any file with a dot as the first character is hidden from normal view in Linux. Issue the following command to create a copy and begin editing the file.

````
    <copy>
    cp .env.template .env
    </copy>
````

   ![Copy and edit the env file](./images/env-file-copy.png " ")

16. Use your favorite editor to open and edit the file.

    ````
        <copy>
        nano .env
        </copy>
    ````

17. The following information needs to be collected and inserted into the .env file. Copy the 9 lines below and paste them in the .evn file. Follow the steps below to gather the required information and place it in the file.

    ```
        <copy>
        USERNAME=""
        DBPASSWORD=""

    ````

28. Your .env file should look similar to the screenshot below. (*Don't forget the sinqle quotes around the connection string!*)

    ![.env credentials](./images/env-file.png " ")

29. Save and close the .env file.

## Task 4: Create the application environment

1. Create a Virtual Environment. It is recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate application dependencies. In your terminal, run the following command to create a virtual environment.

    ````
        <copy>
        python3.11 -m venv loan_env
        </copy>
    ````

    This will create a directory calledâ€¯loan_envâ€¯that will contain your virtual environment.

2. Enable the firewall for the application port. Run the following commands:

    ````
        <copy>
        sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8501/tcp --permanent
        </copy>
    ````

    ````
        <copy>
        sudo firewall-cmd --reload
        </copy>
    ````

    ````
        <copy>
        nohup streamlit run 1-Introduction.py --server.port 8501 --server.address 0.0.0.0 > streamlit.log 2>&1 &
        </copy>
    ````

    ![Enable the firewall](./images/enable-firewall.png " ")

3. Create the streamlit.service file to allow management of the streamlit app like any other service.

    ````
        <copy>
        sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/streamlit.service
        </copy>
    ````


4. Copy and paste the following information into the file. Verify the user is 'opc' and the port is set to 8501.

    ````
        <copy>

6. Success! You should see the application start screen.

    ![Application start screen](./images/application-start-screen.png " ")

Congratulations, you have built and configured the Loan Management application using Oracle Cloud Insfrastructure, Oracle Autonomous Database, and Oracle GenAI!


## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the setup, here are a few common troubleshooting tips:

* **Missing Keys or Permissions**: Double-check your .oci/config for typos and ensure the key file path is correct and readable. 

* **OCI SDK Errors**: Ensure the required OCI Python SDK is installed:

    ````
        <copy>
        pip install oci
        </copy
    ````

* **GenAI Access Issues**: Verify your user/group has the correct IAM policy applied.

* **Virtual Environment Not Activating**: Ensure that you're using the correct command for your operating system. If the issue persists, try recreating the virtual environment.

* **Dependencies Installation Issues**: Double-check theâ€¯requirements.txtâ€¯file to ensure it contains the correct package names. If a specific package fails, you can try installing it manually withâ€¯pip install <package-name>.

* **Database Connection Errors**: Ensure that the database credentials in theâ€¯.envâ€¯file are correct and that you have access to the Autonomous Database. 

## Additional Notes

* Your .oci/config and .environment files contain sensitive credentials. Do not commit them to version control.

* Keep your oci\_api\_key.pem secure and never share it.

* If you use multiple OCI profiles, you can add them to ~/.oci/config and reference them explicitly in your code.

* This setup is intended for development and local testing purposes. If you're looking to deploy the application in production, additional configuration and security hardening may be required.

* Ensure that your system's Python version is compatible (3.9 or higher) and that the virtual environment is activated whenever you work on the application.

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined above, you should be able to set up and run the application locally. If you face any issues, refer to the troubleshooting section or contact the support team for assistance.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
