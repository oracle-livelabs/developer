8. Create administrator credentials. **We will need the DB Username and Password for our .env file later. Take note of these credentials.** 

   **Password** and **Confirm Password** - Specify the password for ADMIN user of the service instance. The password must meet the following requirements:<br><br>
   1) The password must be between 12 and 30 characters long and must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one numeric character.<br><br>
   2) The password cannot contain the username.<br><br>
   3) The password cannot contain the double quote (") character.<br><br>
   4) The password must be different from the last 4 passwords used.<br><br>
   5) The password must not be the same password that is set less than 24 hours ago.<br><br>
   6) Re-enter the password to confirm it. Make a note of this password.

   ![Set administrator credentials](./images/create-admin.png " ")

9. Choose network access:

   For this lab, accept the default, **Secure access from everywhere**.<br><br>
   If you want to allow traffic only from the IP addresses and VCNs you specify where access to the database from all public IPs or VCNs is blocked, select **Secure access from allowed IPs and VCNs only**.<br><br>
   If you want to restrict access to a private endpoint within an OCI VCN, select **Private endpoint access only**.<br><br>
   If the **Require mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication** option is selected, mTLS will be required to authenticate connections to your Autonomous Database. TLS connections allows Oracle Data Provider for .NET to connect to your Autonomous Database without a wallet. See the [documentation for network options](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/adbsa/support-tls-mtls-authentication.html#GUID-3F3F1FA4-DD7D-4211-A1D3-A74ED35C0AF5) for options to allow TLS, or to require only mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication.

## Task 3: Unzip the Code

1. Unzip the application codeâ€¯to a directory of your choice on your local machine: 

    
    [**Application Code**] (https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/fiiLFGXKlmgrZKSwKQkD2Wc7mf5b8OsPUmIsw4rNUPcbBO31Za8T1NNoGAf0l4_S/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/developer-library/pages.zip)   


2. Navigate to the folder where the code is located. 

    cd /path/to/your/unzipped/code 
    ![Navigate to folder](./images/folder.png " ")


## Task 4: Install Python 3.11 

To run the application, Python versionâ€¯3.11â€¯or higher is required. Follow the steps below to ensure Python is installed on your machine. 

1. Run the following command to check which version of Python is installed.

    ````
        <copy>
        python3 --version
        </copy>
    ````
    ![Check Python Version](./images/python-version.png " ")

2. If Python 3.11 is not installed, download and install Python 3.11 from theâ€¯[**official website**](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You can also run the following command.

    ````
        <copy>
        sudo dnf install python3.11
        </copy>
    ````

    ![Check Python Version is Installed](./images/python-version-installed.png " ")

## Task 5: Setting Up the Local Environment 

1. Create a Virtual Environment. It is recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies. In your terminal, run the following command to create a virtual environment: 


    ````
        <copy>
        python3 -m venv venv
        </copy>
    ````

    This will create a directory calledâ€¯venvâ€¯that contains your virtual environment. 


2. Enable the Virtual Environment. Once the virtual environment is created, activate it using the following commands based on your operating system: 

    Onâ€¯macOS/Linux: 

    ````
        <copy>
        source venv/bin/activate
        </copy>
    ```` 

    Onâ€¯Windows: 

    ````
        <copy>
        .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate 
        </copy>
    ```` 

    After activation, your terminal should showâ€¯(venv)â€¯at the beginning of the line, indicating that the virtual environment is active. 
        ![Virtual Environment](./images/virtual-environment.png " ")

3. Install Streamlit and Dependencies. The application has a set of required dependencies that need to be installed. You can install them using theâ€¯requirements.txtâ€¯file. 

    Run the following commands to install all dependencies: 

    ````
        <copy>
        pip install oci 
        </copy>
    ```` 

    ````
        <copy>
        pip install streamlit 
        </copy>
    ```` 

    ````
        <copy>
        pip freeze > requirements.txt 
        </copy
    ```` 

    ````
        <copy>
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        </copy
    ```` 

    This will ensure that all required libraries are installed within your virtual environment. 

    ![Required Libraries](./images/requirements.png " ")

4. Create aâ€¯.envâ€¯File. You need to create aâ€¯.envâ€¯file in the root directory of the project to configure the database connection details. 

    ````
        <copy>
        vi .env
        </copy
    ````

5. Insert the variables below into the file. Replaceâ€¯the valuesâ€¯with the actual values you obtained during the provisioning of the Autonomous Database. You should have captured your database username and password in task 1 of this lab. 

    DB\_USERNAME=Your\_DB\_Username 

    DB\_PASSWORD=Your\_DB\_Password 

    DB\_CONNECTION\_STRING=Your\_DB\_Connection\_String

    COMPARTMENT\_OCID=Your\_DB\_Compartment\_ID

    ENDPOINT=Your\_endpoint\_url 

    ADB\_OCID=Your\_DB\_OCI\_ID 

6. Find your database connection string by selecting **Database Connection**.

    ![Select Database Connection](./images/db-connection.png " ")

7. Copy the low connection string. This is the connection string you will place into the .env file.

    ![Copy Connection String](./images/connection-string.png " ")

8. To locate your compartment OCID, navigate to **Identity & Security** -> **Compartments**.

    ![Click Compartments](./images/compartments.png " ")

10. Copy your compartment OCID. Place the compartment OCID into your .env file.

    ![Select your Compartment](./images/copy-ocid.png " ")

11. Paste this in as your endpoint url in the .env file:

    ````
        <copy>
        https://inference.generativeai.us-chicago-1.oci.oraclecloud.com
        </copy
    ````
12. Navigate back to your Autonomous Database to copy your ADB OCID. Click **Oracle Database** -> **Autonomous Database**.

   ![Select Autonomous Database from menu](./images/select-atp.png" ")

13. Select your Autonomous Database.

    ![Select your Autonomous Database](./images/select-your-adb.png " ")

14. Copy your Autonomous Database OCID. Paste it into your .env file.

    ![Copy your Autonomous Database OCID](./images/adb-ocid.png " ")

    You should now have all of the credentials for your .env file filled in.

    ![.env credentials](./images/env-credentials.png " ")

6. Navigate back to your terminal and paste the following command in to create a config directory. 

    ````
        <copy>
        mkdir -p ~/.oci
        </copy
    ```` 

7.  Create the config file at ~/.oci/config with the following command: 

    ````
        <copy>
        vi config
        </copy
    ```` 

8. Insert the variables below: 

    > ðŸ’¡Note: Replace all placeholders with your actual OCI credentials and key file path except region, which must be us-chicago.

    ````
        <copy>
        [DEFAULT] 
        user=[ocid1.user.oc1..exampleuniqueID]
        fingerprint=[xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx]

    ![Click Generative AI](./images/click-generative-ai.png " ")

## Task 7: Run the Application

1. Now that everything is set up, you can start the application by running the following command: 

    ````
        <copy>
        streamlit run 1-introduction.py
        </copy
    ````

    This will start the application locally, using both your Autonomous Database and OCI GenAI services. 


## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the setup, here are a few common troubleshooting tips: 

* **Missing Keys or Permissions**: Double-check your .oci/config for typos and ensure the key file path is correct and readable. 

* **OCI SDK Errors**: Ensure the required OCI Python SDK is installed: 

    ````
        <copy>
        pip install oci
        </copy
    ````  

* **GenAI Access Issues**: Verify your user/group has the correct IAM policy applied. 

* **Virtual Environment Not Activating**: Ensure that you're using the correct command for your operating system. If the issue persists, try recreating the virtual environment. 

* **Dependencies Installation Issues**: Double-check theâ€¯requirements.txtâ€¯file to ensure it contains the correct package names. If a specific package fails, you can try installing it manually withâ€¯pip install <package-name>. 

* **Database Connection Errors**: Ensure that the database credentials in theâ€¯.envâ€¯file are correct and that you have access to the Autonomous Database. 

## Additional Notes
* Your .oci/config and .environment files contain sensitive credentials. Do not commit them to version control. 

* Keep your oci\_api\_key.pem secure and never share it. 

* If you use multiple OCI profiles, you can add them to ~/.oci/config and reference them explicitly in your code. 

* This setup is intended for development and local testing purposes. If you're looking to deploy the application in production, additional configurations may be required. 

* Ensure that your system's Python version is compatible (3.9 or higher) and that the virtual environment is activated whenever you work on the application. 

## Conclusion
By following the steps outlined above, you should be able to set up and run the application locally. If you face any issues, refer to the troubleshooting section or contact the support team for assistance. 

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
