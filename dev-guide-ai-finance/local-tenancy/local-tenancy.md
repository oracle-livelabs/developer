Congratulations, you have built and configured the Loan Management application using Oracle Cloud Insfrastructure, Oracle Autonomous Database, and Oracle GenAI!


## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the setup, here are a few common troubleshooting tips:

* **Missing Keys or Permissions**: Double-check your .oci/config for typos and ensure the key file path is correct and readable. 

* **OCI SDK Errors**: Ensure the required OCI Python SDK is installed:

    ````
        <copy>
        pip install oci
        </copy
    ````

* **GenAI Access Issues**: Verify your user/group has the correct IAM policy applied.

* **Virtual Environment Not Activating**: Ensure that you're using the correct command for your operating system. If the issue persists, try recreating the virtual environment.

* **Dependencies Installation Issues**: Double-check theâ€¯requirements.txtâ€¯file to ensure it contains the correct package names. If a specific package fails, you can try installing it manually withâ€¯pip install <package-name>.

* **Database Connection Errors**: Ensure that the database credentials in theâ€¯.envâ€¯file are correct and that you have access to the Autonomous Database. 

## Additional Notes

* Your .oci/config and .environment files contain sensitive credentials. Do not commit them to version control.

* Keep your oci\_api\_key.pem secure and never share it.

* If you use multiple OCI profiles, you can add them to ~/.oci/config and reference them explicitly in your code.

* This setup is intended for development and local testing purposes. If you're looking to deploy the application in production, additional configuration and security hardening may be required.

* Ensure that your system's Python version is compatible (3.9 or higher) and that the virtual environment is activated whenever you work on the application.

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined above, you should be able to set up and run the application locally. If you face any issues, refer to the troubleshooting section or contact the support team for assistance.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
