## Task 1: Graph Developer Coding Exercise

**Task**:

The loan officer is requesting an additional graph to be added to the decision page to visualize additional loan options based on credit score and debt-to-income ratio. Specifically, they want to display an additional graph that shows loan options based on two key metrics: required credit score on one axis and debt-to-income ratio on the other.
