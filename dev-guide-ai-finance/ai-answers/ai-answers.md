Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Enhance your understanding of AI Vector Search by applying it to a real-world developer coding challenge.
* Gain hands-on experience with integrating AI Vector Search and refining application features to meet specific development requirements.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* An Oracle Cloud account
* Successfully completed Lab 1: Workshop Details and Prerequisites
* Successfully completed Lab 2: SeerEquities AI App in Action

## Task 1: Hackathon Challenge
The company has requested an enhancement to the current loan recommendation system. The loan officer has indicated that the existing 3 loan options are insufficient, and they'd like to see the top 5 loan options instead.

1. Update the Customers.py and Decision.py files to make the necessary changes in the code so that the AI prompt returns the top 5 loans instead of the current 3.

2. Ensure the output displays the top 5 loans like the image below:

## Task 3: Modify the Cutomers.py File

1. Click **Pages**.

    ![Click Pages](./images/click-pages.png " ")

2. Select the **Customers.py** file.

    ![Click Customers.py](./images/customers-py.png " ")

3. On lines 477 and 478, change the value 3 to **5**, as we need to display the top 5 loan recommendations instead of 3.

    ![Change 3 to 5](./images/3to5-1.png " ")

4. Save the Customers.py file.

    ![Save Customers.py](./images/save-customers-py.png " ")

## Task 4: Modify the Decision.py File

1. Select the **Decision.py** file.

    ![Click Decision.py](./images/decision-py.png " ")

2. On line 283, change the value 3 to **5**.

    ![Change 3 to 5](./images/3to5-2.png " ")

3. On line 297, change the value 3 to **5**.

    ![Change 3 to 5](./images/3to5-3.png " ")

4. On line 312, change the value 3 to **5**.

    ![Change 3 to 5](./images/3to5-4.png " ")

5. Save the Decision.py file.

    ![Save Decision.py](./images/save-decision-py.png " ")

## Task 5: Launch the Application

1. Select the **Launcher** tab and open the **terminal**

    ![Open Terminal](./images/open-terminal.png " ")

2. Copy the ./run.sh command and paste it into the terminal.

    ````bash
        $<copy>
        ./run.sh
        </copy>
    ````

3. Click the URL displayed in the terminal to launch the SeerEquities Loan Management application.

    ![Click the URL](./images/click-url.png " ")

4. Enter in a username and click **Login**.

    ![Login](./images/login.png " ")

## Task 6: View the Results

1. On the Dashboard page, from the pending review list, select the Customer ID for **James Smith**.

    ![Select James Smith](./images/james-smith.png " ")

2. This will display the customers loan application details. In approximately 15 seconds, the 5 AI generated loan recommendations will be displayed.
