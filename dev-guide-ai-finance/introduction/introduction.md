# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop, we will explore how to build a cutting-edge GenAI powered loan approval application leveraging Oracle Autonomous Database and the latest Oracle Database 23ai features.  

The workshop includes developer coding challenges that will allow advanced developers to gain hands on experience enhancing a live application that incorporates the use of **Generative AI**, **AI Chatbots**, **AI Vector Search**, **RAG**, **JSON Duality views**, & **Property Graphs** to help a loan officer quickly analyze loan application requests & determine the best loan products for the customer. 

The lab solution you will build will generate data-driven insights by integrating data that is structured in various formats, from internal & external sources. By harnessing the robust capabilities of the Oracle AI Data Platform, the loan officers can streamline document processing, accelerate loan approvals, and leverage in-line generative AI to fine tune loan options in real-time, while ensuring compliance with company and regulatory compliance policies.

**About Oracle AI Vector Search**

Oracle AI Vector Search is a feature of Oracle Database 23ai that enables efficient searching of AI-generated vectors stored in the database. It supports fast search using various indexing strategies and can handle massive amounts of vector data. This makes it possible for Large Language Models (LLMs) to query private business data using a natural language interface, helping them provide more accurate and relevant results. Additionally, AI Vector Search allows developers to easily add semantic search capabilities to both new and existing applications.

**About Generative artificial intelligence (AI)** 

Generative AI excels at creating text responses based on large language models (LLMs) where the AI is trained on a massive number of data points. The good news is that the generated text is often easy to read and provides detailed responses that are broadly applicable to the questions asked of the software, often called prompts.

The bad news is that the information used to generate the response is limited to the information used to train the AI, often a generalized LLM. The LLM’s data may be weeks, months, or years out of date and in a corporate AI chatbot may not include specific information about the organization’s products or services. That can lead to incorrect responses that erode confidence in the technology among customers and employees.

That’s where **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** comes in. RAG provides a way to optimize the output of an LLM with targeted information without modifying the underlying model itself; that targeted information can be more up-to-date than the LLM as well as specific to a particular organization and industry. That means the generative AI system can provide more contextually appropriate answers to prompts as well as base those answers on extremely current data.

### Objectives

The primary goal of this workshop is to demonstrate **Oracle Database 23ai’s** capabilities in automating and enhancing the loan approval process. Through hands-on demonstrations and technical deep-dives, the workshop will guide attendees through the process of integrating Oracle 23ai features into a custom web application.  
By leveraging **AI Vector Search**, **Graph**, and **JSON/JSON DUALITY VIEWS**, this project will help participants understand how to: 

 
* Use AI Vector Search to ask questions about the applicant’s financial data. 

* Track the loan approval status and update loan applications. 

* Generate PDF reports on loan decisions. 

* Analyze applicant data using a Graph. 

* Send AI-generated emails to applicants notifying them of their approval status. 

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* An Oracle account
