This workshop demonstrates how developers and business executives alike can harness Oracle Database 23ai’s AI Vector Search, Graph Analytics, and JSON/JSON Duality Views to create a highly intelligent mortgage loan underwriting system. By presenting a real-world mortgage loan scenario, we’ll guide participants through every step of the process, showcasing how these advanced tools can be applied to modern banking and finance.

### Objectives

The primary goal of this workshop is to demonstrate Oracle Database 23ai’s capabilities in automating and enhancing the mortgage underwriting process. By leveraging AI Vector Search, Graph, and JSON/JSON DUALITY VIEWS, this project will help participants understand how to:

* Upload mortgage application data in PDF format.
* Use AI Vector Search to ask questions about the applicant’s financial data.
* Analyze applicant data using a Wealth Management Graph.
* Track the loan approval status and update loan applications.
* Generate PDF reports on loan decisions.
* Send AI-generated emails to applicants notifying them of their approval status.
* Through hands-on demonstrations and technical deep-dives, the workshop will guide attendees through the process of integrating these AI-driven features into a custom web application designed for mortgage loan underwriting.
