# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop, you will build a GenAI-powered loan approval app using Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle Database 23ai.

#### ➡️ **Start with the demo!**

The demo shows how a loan officer uses Generative AI, Vector Search, and Graph analytics to evaluate real applications and streamline decisions.  
The best part? **No setup required**—just start with Lab 1 and follow the guide.  
You can explore guided use cases or experiment on your own using the demo application.

#### ➡️ **Start coding!**

If you want to get hands-on and start interacting with the database using Python, then Lab 3 and Lab 4 are for you.  
Lab 2 describes how to get access to our browser-based development environment.  
Make sure to check it out before continuing to Lab 3, where you will learn how to use Python with Oracle Database 23ai:

✅ Connect to the database using Python

✅ Run SQL queries with Python

✅ Create JSON Duality Views

✅ Connect to the database using a Mongo API driver

✅ Use the Mongo API to query and update data

✅ Implement AI Vector Search

In lab 4, you will learn how to **implement a working example of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using Oracle Database 23ai.**

#### ➡️ **Start experimenting!**

You can also experiment with the code in your own environment. The workshop environment is flexible and allows you try out different things:  
Start building your own version of the loan approval application!

To get things started we invite you to watch the introduction video to see the demo in action:
