### Objectives

The primary goal of this workshop is to demonstrate **Oracle Database 23ai’s** capabilities in automating and enhancing the mortgage underwriting process. Through hands-on demonstrations and technical deep-dives, the workshop will guide attendees through the process of integrating Oracle 23ai features into a custom web application designed for mortgage loan underwriting.  
By leveraging **AI Vector Search**, **Graph**, and **JSON/JSON DUALITY VIEWS**, this project will help participants understand how to: 

 
* Use AI Vector Search to ask questions about the applicant’s financial data. 

* Track the loan approval status and update loan applications. 

* Generate PDF reports on loan decisions. 

* Analyze applicant data using a Wealth Management Graph. 

* Send AI-generated emails to applicants notifying them of their approval status.
