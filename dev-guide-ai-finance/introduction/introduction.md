# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop, you will build a GenAI app on Oracle Database 23ai.

Estimated time: 2-3 hours

#### ➡️ **Start with the demo!**

Check out the demo to see how Generative AI and Vector Search in the database, can operate against multiple types of data—empowering you to build real applications and make faster, smarter decisions. The best part? **No setup required**—just start with Lab 1 and follow the guide. You can explore guided use cases or experiment on your own using the demo application.

#### ➡️ **Start coding!**

Lab 2 describes how to get access to our browser-based development environment. Make sure to check it out before continuing to Lab 3 and 4, where you will get hands-on and start interacting with Python with Oracle Database 23ai:

✅ Connect to the database using Python

✅ Run SQL queries with Python

✅ Create JSON Duality Views

✅ Connect to the database using a Mongo API driver

✅ Use the Mongo API to query and update data

✅ Implement AI Vector Search

In lab 4, you will learn how to **implement a working example of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using Oracle Database 23ai.**

#### ➡️ **Start experimenting!**

You can also experiment with the code in your own environment. The workshop environment is flexible and allows you try out different things: Start building your own version of the loan approval application!

To get things started we invite you to watch the introduction video to see the demo in action:
