# Introduction

## About this Workshop

SeerEquities, a fictional financial services firm, is under pressure to speed up loan approvals without sacrificing accuracy or compliance. Their data team is reimagining the loan approval process using Oracle Database 23ai—combining AI with the database to power faster, more contextual decisions.

In this hands-on workshop, you’ll step into the role of **a SeerEquities developer** helping build a GenAI-powered loan approval system. **Your goal:** combine enterprise data with large language models (LLMs) to generate personalized recommendations, answer customer questions, and automate financial workflows—all inside Oracle Database 23ai.

You’ll learn how to:

* ✅ Use **native Vector Search** to query structured data, documents, and unstructured text—without moving data across systems  
* ✅ Combine **LLMs with enterprise data** using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
* ✅ Automate loan workflows using **JSON Duality Views** and Oracle’s **Mongo API**

By the end of this workshop, you’ll understand how Oracle Database 23ai helps companies like SeerEquities:

* ✅ Accelerate decisions with centralized, AI-ready data  
* ✅ Build intelligent apps with zero external vector infrastructure  
* ✅ Deliver governed, context-aware answers using your own data

**Start building where your data already lives—with Oracle Database 23ai.**

### 🔧 What You’ll Do

You’ll work through five interactive labs:

- **Lab 1** – Connect to the cloud-based development environment (JupyterLab)
- **Lab 2** – Learn Python basics and explore Oracle’s JSON Duality Views + Mongo APIs
- **Lab 3** – Build a complete loan recommendation system using Oracle Database 23ai and GenAI
- **Lab 4a/4b** – Complete a coding challenge using AI Vector Search
- **Lab 5** – (Optional) Try running the app in your own local environment

Each lab builds toward a real-world AI use case: generating accurate, personalized loan recommendations from customer data—with secure, governed access.

### 🚀 Ready to Start?

Jump into **Lab 1** to launch your JupyterLab environment.

From there, you’ll:

* ✅ Connect to Oracle Database 23ai using Python
* ✅ Run SQL and JSON queries
* ✅ Implement an RAG process

You can also explore and experiment beyond the guided steps—modify code, try your own queries, or build on the application logic. By the final lab, you’ll have built the core of the SeerEquities AI Loan Assistant, ready to support real-time loan approvals.

### Objectives

* Understand how Oracle Database 23ai powers real-world AI applications  
* Learn Python integration using `oracledb` and `pymongo`  
* Build, vectorize, and search embedded documents with AI Vector Search  
* Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using native database features  
* Apply these tools to a financial loan approval scenario  

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle account to submit your a LiveLabs Sandbox reservation.

* Basic knowledge of Python.

* Familiarity with SQL and Oracle Database is helpful, but not required
