# SeerEquities AI App in Action

## Introduction

In this lab, you will step into the role of a loan officer using a next-generation loan approval application powered by Oracle Database 23ai. You will work with real loan applications and see how Generative AI, Vector Search, and Graph analytics replace manual review with faster, AI-driven decision-making.

Estimated Lab Time: 45 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Walk through a demo of the SeerEquities Loan Approval application as a loan officer persona
* Explore the challenges associated with loan approval processing time and learn how the SeerEquities Loan Management app reduces processing and approval time by over 80%!

### Prerequisites
