# Run the Demo

## Introduction

In this lab, you will step into the role of a loan officer using a next-generation loan approval application powered by Oracle Database 23ai. You will work with real loan applications and see how Generative AI, Vector Search, and Graph analytics replace manual review with faster, AI-driven decision-making.

**Disclaimer**: Please note that your results may vary. The information provided is generated by OCI Generative AI services, and your outcomes may differ from those presented.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

## Task 2: Demo - Customer with strong credit score

In this first example, you will use the application to approve a customer with strong credit score. The first user on your to-do list is James Smith.

1. On the Dashboard page, from the pending review list, select the Customer ID for **James Smith**.

    ![Select James Smith](./images/james-smith.png =50%x*)

2. Opening James Smith’s profile reveals his loan application details—name, location, requested amount, debt, and credit score.  

    ![James Smith AI generated recommendations](./images/james-smith-ai.png =50%x*)

3. At the bottom of James Smith’s profile, you will find the **AI Loan Guru**—a chatbot built on Oracle Database 23ai and Vector search. When prompted, the system uses **RAG** to generate a response. It converts the question and loan data into embeddings, performs a similarity search, and then uses the **GenAI service** to turn the enriched context into a clear, natural language answer. If the customer calls with a question, you can quickly enter it into the AI Loan Guru to generate a relevant response. 
 

    **Copy** the question below into the AI chatbot and press **Enter**. What does the AI Loan Guru recommend?

    ```text
    <copy>
    What would be the top 0% down payment loans?
    </copy>
    ```

    ![James Smith chatbot](./images/james-smith-chatbot.png =50%x*)

>💡 In Oracle Database 23ai, **AI Vector Search** allows you to combine your business data with the Large Language Model (LLM) to reduce hallucinations and get accurate answers from your data.

4. Select the **Navigate To Decisions** button.

    ![James Smith Decision](./images/james-smith-decision.png =50%x*)

    After navigating to the decisions page, the AI evaluation runs in the background. It analyzes James’s profile and matches it against available loan options in the database. A custom AI prompt ensures the system uses only internal data—never the internet. In this case, the AI returns three loan options, each with a clear explanation. All options are displayed alongside the AI’s final recommendation: approval.

5. In the **Select Final Approved Loan Option** section, the available loan options are displayed. The loan officer can choose to request more information to refine the offer, but for this scenario, we will proceed by selecting one of the suggested loans.

    ![James Smith Select Final Approved Loan](./images/james-smith-select-final-loan.png =50%x*)

6. Select the AI-recommended loan labeled as the military veteran loan with the shortest time to close. In this example, that is Loan 26—the only military veteran option shown. 

    >Please note that your results may vary. The information provided is generated by OCI Generative AI services, and your outcomes may differ from those presented.

    ![James Smith Select Loan 3](./images/james-smith-select-loan.png =50%x*)

7. Set the final loan status to **Approved**, then click **Save Final Approval & Loan Status** to complete the process.

    The loan status has been updated to 'Approved' and saved to the customer profile.

    ![James Smith Save Loan Status](./images/james-smith-save.png =50%x*)

8.  Click the **Generate Decision as PDF** button.

    ![James Smith Download Recommendation](./images/james-smith-download.png =50%x*)

9.  Click **Download PDF**

    ![James Smith Download PDF](./images/james-smith-download-pdf.png =50%x*)

10. Display the message the customer would see by opening the downloaded PDF.

    ![Open James Smith PDF](./images/open-james-smith-pdf.png =50%x*)

11. Click the **Return to Dashboard** button to navigate back to the Dashboard.

    ![Return to Dashboard](./images/james-return-dashboard.png =50%x*)

12. Expand **View Approved Customers**. We can see that James Smith has been removed from the Pending Review Loan Requests list and has been added to the Approved Loan Requests list.

    ![James Smith Approved List](./images/james-smith-approved-list.png =50%x*)

**Conclusion**

Once you select and save one of the 3 loans recommended by the AI: 

✅ The customer's loan status is updated.

✅ A finalized PDF decision document is generated.  

✅ The dashboard reflects the change in real-time — marking James as Approved.

Congratulations, you have just approved your first customer loan! Proceed to the next task.

## Task 3: Demo - Denying a customer with high risk
In this example, you will navigate the application to review a customer and deny them as part of the exercise. The second user on your to-do list is James Woods.

1. On the Dashboard page, from the pending review list, select the Customer ID for **James Woods**.

    ![Select James Woods](./images/james-woods.png =50%x*)

2. Opening James Woods’s profile displays his loan application details. Within a few seconds, the AI automatically generates recommendations. In this case, the system evaluates a less favorable profile and identifies key risk factors.

    This customer has:

    * **$5000 in income**
    * A **low credit score**
    * And is requesting a **high loan amount**

    Despite the risk factors, the AI evaluates the profile and suggests next steps. In this case, it recommends a denial—but also provides clear, actionable guidance to help the customer improve their chances of approval in the future.

    ![James Woods AI generated recommendations](./images/james-woods-ai.png =50%x*)

3. Select the **Navigate to Decisions** button.

    ![James Woods Decision](./images/james-woods-decision.png =50%x*)

>⁉️ **What is the reason that the AI decided to deny this applicant?** ⁉️


4. Expand **View Dot Plot: Client-Loan Relationships** to view the graph.

    ![James Woods Graph](./images/expand-graph.png =50%x*)

    On the decision page, the loan officer can use **Operational Property Graph** to explore near-approval loan scenarios. Built with **Oracle Graph**, this feature visually maps loans just out of reach and highlights what adjustments—like increasing income or reducing debt—could improve eligibility.

    ![James Woods Graph](./images/james-woods-graph2.png =50%x*)

>💡 In Oracle Database 23ai, **Property Graph** allows you to treat your data like a network of connected points, where each point (called a node) and each link (called an edge) has its own details or properties. This setup helps you run graph analytics, like finding important connections or patterns, directly within the database.

5. The loan status is set to **Denied**. Click the **Save Final Approval & Loan Status** button.

    The loan status has been updated to 'Denied' and saved to the customer profile.

    ![James Woods Save Loan Status](./images/james-woods-save.png =50%x*)

6. Press the **Generate Decision as PDF** button to save the AI responses and proceed to the final loan disposition.

    ![James Woods PDF](./images/james-woods-pdf.png =50%x*)

7. Click the **Download PDF** button.

    ![James Woods Download Recommendation](./images/james-woods-download.png =50%x*)

8. Display the message the customer would see by opening the downloaded PDF.

    ![Open James Woods PDF](./images/open-james-woods-pdf.png =50%x*)

9. Click the **Return to Dashboard** button to navigate back to the Dashboard.

    ![Return to Dashboard](./images/woods-return-dashboard.png =50%x*)

10. Expand **View Denied Customers**. You will see that James Woods has been moved from the **Pending Review Loan Requests** list to the **Denied Loan Requests** list.

    ![James Woods Denied List](./images/james-woods-denied-list.png =50%x*)

**Conclusion**

Congratulations, you have finished reviewing a customer with high financial risk! Proceed to the next task.

## Task 4: Demo - Update customer details

Lastly, let’s explore how the system uses JSON Duality Views to handle profile updates. In this task, you will edit a customer’s details. In this example, the customer was asked to submit updated proof of income.

1. On the Dashboard page, from the **Pending Review Loan Requests** list, select the customer ID for **Alex Anderson**.

    ![Select Alex Anderson](./images/select-alex-anderson.png =50%x*)

2. We will upload a document to update Alex's income. Before uploading the document, note that the customer’s income is currently listed as $25,000. On the Customer Details page, click the **Upload Document** button.

    ![Upload Document](./images/upload-document.png =50%x*)

3. The PDF file has been loaded. Click the **Process Selected PDF** button.

    ![Click Process Selected PDF](./images/process-selected-pdf.png =50%x*)

>💡 **JSON Duality Views** in 23ai let's you update unstructured data in an easy, high-level format while automatically handling the technical details behind the scenes. This makes it faster and simpler to work with messy data and connect it to structured systems.

4. The customer profile has been updated.

    ![Customer Profile Updated](./images/profile-updated.png)

5. Refresh the page and note that the income has been updated to $65,000. Thanks to JSON Transform and JSON Duality Views, only the relevant field is modified — leaving the rest of the profile UNTOUCHED.

    ![Customer Profile Updated](./images/income-updated.png)

**Conclusion**

Once the document is uploaded:

✅ The system automatically detects the new income data.

✅ Then their profile will be updated from $25,000 to $65,000.

✅ And thanks to JSON Transform and JSON Duality Views, only the relevant field is modified — leaving the rest of the profile UNTOUCHED.

## Summary
