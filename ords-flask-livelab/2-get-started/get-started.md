# Get Started

## Introduction

You have been provided with three URLs; one is an OCI Object Storage location, another for signing in to Database Actions, and another for accessing a Jupyter lab.  

In this lab, you retrieve the sample application files, configure your sample application, and then execute commands to start-up this sample application.

Some experience in shell commands, Python, JavaScript, and HTML are helpful but not necessary. We've designed this workshop so even the beginner can complete it!

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Obtain the application project contents from OCI Cloud Storage
* Sign in to Database Actions as the `MOVIE` user
* Create your ORDS APIs with the provided scripts
* Add your ORDS APIs to your project's files
* Start-up a simple ORDS + Python application

### Prerequisites

* An OCI Always Free, Free Tier, or paid tenancy
* A provisioned Oracle Autonomous Database and Integrated Developer Environment (IDE), or
* Access to a LiveLabs-provided sandbox environment
* Access to Database Actions
* Beginner-level experience in Python, HTML, and Integrated Developer Environments (IDEs)

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle account
* All previous labs successfully completed

## Task 1: Retrieve the project from OCI Cloud Storage

1. You have been provided three URLs. One for accessing Database Actions, one for accessing a Jupyter lab, and another for retrieving the sample application project file from OCI Cloud Storage. [Click here](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/labfiles/ocw24flask.zip) to download a copy of the application's project files.  

   If you are unable to click the hyperlink, copy the direct link below, and navigate to it in a new browser tab:  

     ```html
     <copy>
     https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/labfiles/ocw24flask.zip
     </copy>
     ```

2. Accept any dialogs that may appear, and download the `.zip` file to your `Downloads` folder.  

   ![Accepting terms to download zip file.](images/workshop-presentation-zero-dot-one.png)

   > If you choose to download this file to another folder, note its location. Later, you will need to transfer this `.zip` file to the Jupyter lab.

## Task 2: Database Actions, Part I

1. You have been provided two additional URLs. One for accessing Database Actions, and another one for accessing a Jupyter lab. First, navigate to Database Actions using the provided URL.

2. A new `MOVIE` user has been created for you. Its schema has already been REST-enabled, meaning you will be able to Sign in to Database Actions. To Sign in, click the <button type="button" style="pointer-events: none;">Go</button> button under the SQL Developer Web card.

   ![Navigating to SQL Developer Web.](images/workshop-presentation-one.png " ")

   Once the Sign-in screen appears, enter the following credentials, and click the <button type="button" style="pointer-events: none;">Sign-in</button> button:

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Username: `MOVIE`  
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Password: `LiveLabs.Rocks_99`
  
3. The Database Actions Launchpad will appear. Navigate to the `Development` category, then click `SQL`. A blank SQL Worksheet will appear.

   ![A new SQL Worksheet.](images/workshop-presentation-two.png " ")

      > If this is your first time visiting the SQL Worksheet, a guided tour will appear. You may continue with the tour, or click the <button type="button" style="pointer-events: none;">X</button> (as seen in the image) to exit the tour.

4. You'll notice a `MOVIE` table has already been created for you. This table has also been pre-populated with movie data.

   To view a sample of the table's data<span class="fa fa-file-play" aria-hidden="true"></span> copy and paste the following SQL statement into the SQL Worksheet and click then `Run Statement` icon.

      ```sql
      <copy>
      SELECT * FROM MOVIE FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY;
      </copy>
      ```

   ![Executing the SQL statement.](images/workshop-presentation-three.png " ")

   You will see results similar to the following image:

   ![Reviewing the results.](images/workshop-presentation-four.png " ")

5. You may notice the varied data types in this table. To take a closer look at how this `MOVIE` table is structured, right-click on the `MOVIE` table, then select `Edit...`. When the `Table Properties` slider appears, click `DDL`, then select the `Create` tab.  

   Note the data types:

   ![Reviewing the Movie table properties.](images/workshop-presentation-four-dot-two.png " ")

      > ORDS APIs will be able to handle all of these various data types and send them to your application.

## Task 3: Jupyter lab, Part I

1. Using the second URL you were provided, log in to your Jupyter lab. The password is the same: `LiveLabs.Rocks_99`

   ![Login to Jupyter lab.](images/workshop-presentation-five.png " ")
  
2. Once logged in, you may see several directories. You will need to upload the `ocw24flask` directory to the Jupyter lab. To do this you can simply drag the `.zip` file from your Downloads folder (or from where you saved it to in the earlier Task) into the Jupyter Lab (as seen in the image).  

   ![Drag the zip into the Jupyter lab.](images/workshop-presentation-five-two.png " ")

3. Accept any `Large file size` warnings to upload the file.

   ![Accept large file warning.](images/workshop-presentation-five-three.png " ")

4. Once uploaded, select a new Terminal and unzip the project files using the `unzip ocw24flask.zip` command.  

   ![Unzipping the project folder.](images/workshop-presentation-five-five.png " ")

5. Click into the `ocw24flask` folder, from there the `scripts` folder.  

   ![The scripts folder.](images/workshop-presentation-five-six.png " ")

6. Next, double-click the `moviestream_resource_module_definitions.sql` file. This file contains the definitions for your Resource Module, Templates, and Handlers, which are your ORDS APIs.
  
      ![Reviewing the resource definitions file.](images/workshop-presentation-six.png " ")

7. Select all and copy the contents to your clipboard. Then, return to the SQL Worksheet.

## Task 4: Database Actions, Part II

1. Navigate to the SQL Worksheet. Then paste the contents of the `moviestream_resource_module_definitions.sql` file to the SQL Worksheet.
  
2. Click the `Run Script` icon. Upon completion, a `PL/SQL procedure successfully completed` message will appear in the `Script Output` tab.

   ![Running the resource module script.](images/workshop-presentation-seven.png " ")

   > As you may know, the `MOVIE` schema has already been REST-enabled. For this reason, it is not necessary for you to execute the `ORDS.ENABLE_SCHEMA` PL/SQL procedure. Executing this procedure will cause no disruptions. The full script is provided for your convenience.

3. You've just created the ORDS APIs for the `Movie` user. To review the Resource Module, its Resource Templates and Resource Handlers, navigate to the REST Workshop.

   Click the hamburger menu from the top of Database Actions, then click REST.

   ![Navigating to the REST Workshop.](images/workshop-presentation-eight.png " ")

4. You'll notice a single Module in the Workshop's Object panel. Click it, then click the `moviestream` card.

   ![Navigating to the moviestream resource module.](images/workshop-presentation-nine.png " ")

5. You'll now see the newly created Resource Templates. Each Template contains a single `GET` Resource Handler. These are your ORDS APIs; you'll rely on them to feed data to your application.

   ![Acknowledging the resource templates.](images/workshop-presentation-ten.png " ")

6. Next, copy each of these URI's to your clipboard.

   > In a few moments, you will return to the Jupyter lab to input these into the application code.

   ![Adding the ORDS URIs to the clipboard](images/workshop-presentation-eleven.png " ")

## Task 5: Jupyter Lab, Part II

1. Navigate back to the Jupyter lab. Once there, locate the `ocw24flask` directory. Double click the `ordsflask.py` file.

   ![Locating the ordsflask python file.](images/workshop-presentation-twelve.png)

   You will notice two request variables, `r1` and `r2`. They will both have temporary, placeholder URIs.

2. Replace the `r1` temporary URI with the one you captured in the previous lab. The ORDS URI ending in `/movie-genre` will go here. Next, replace the `/r2` temporary URI with the `/movie-all` URI.

   Verify that your `r1` and `r2` variables are structured like those in the image. Then, save your changes.

   ![Locating the ordsflask python file.](images/workshop-presentation-thirteen.png " ")

3. Next, locate the `static` directory, then double-click the `functions.js` file. Here, you will see another ORDS URI placeholder. Replace it with your `/movie-single/:id` URI.

   Verify that your `const response = ...` is structured exactly as the image shows (your URI will differ). Then, save your changes.

   ![Modifying the function.js file.](images/workshop-presentation-fourteen.png " ")

## Task 6: Start the Flask application

1. From the Jupyter Launcher, open a new Terminal. If you are not in the `ords24flask` folder, then `cd` to it. Issue the `ls` command to verify the `ordsflask.py` file exists.

   Issue the following command:

      ```sh
      <copy>
      python ordsflask.py
      </copy>
      ```  

   The Flask development server will start up.

   ![Executing terminal commands to start the Flask server.](images/workshop-presentation-fifteen.png " ")

2. Your application will be available on port 5000. However, you will need to open the application in a new tab and modify the URL you were given for the Jupyter lab and Database Actions. This can be seen in the following image and your lab's terminal.

   Navigate to the new tab and combine the lab's URI with port 5000. Accept any warnings and your application will load.

   ![Navigating to your application.](images/workshop-presentation-sixteen.png)

3. With the application running, we'll next explore the ORDS APIs and how they feed data to your application.
