## Task 2: Demo - Approving a patient with low authorization risk score

In this first example, you will use the application to approve a patient with a low authorization risk score. The fourth user on your to-do list is Amelie Shepherd.

1. On the Dashboard page, from the pending review list, select the Patient ID for **Amelie Shepherd**.

    ![Select Amelie Shepherd](./images/amelie-shepherd.png =50%x*)

2. Opening Amelie Shepherd’s profile reveals her prior authorization request details—name, email, request ID, and authorization status.  

    ![Amelie Shepherd AI generated recommendations](./images/amelie-shepherd-ai.png =50%x*)

3. At the bottom of Amelie Shepherd’s profile, you will find the **AI Guru**—a chatbot built on Oracle Database 23ai and Vector search. When prompted, the system uses **RAG** to generate a response. It converts the question and healthcare data into embeddings, performs a similarity search, and then uses the **GenAI service** to turn the enriched context into a clear, natural language answer. If the customer calls with a question, you can quickly enter it into the AI Healthcare Guru to generate a relevant response. 
 

    **Copy** the question below into the AI chatbot and press **Enter**. What does the AI Guru respond?

>💡 In Oracle Database 23ai, **AI Vector Search** allows you to combine your business data with a Large Language Model (LLM) to reduce hallucinations and get accurate answers from your data.

4. Select the **Navigate To Decisions** button.

    ![Amelie Shepherd Decision](./images/amelie-shepherd-decision.png =50%x*)

    After navigating to the decisions page, the AI evaluation runs in the background. Clinical documents (e.g., EHR notes, radiology reports, lab results) are stored in Oracle Database 23ai and modeled with JSON Duality Views. These documents are vectorized and searched using AI Vector Search to identify semantically relevant prior cases and policy criteria. The results are passed to OCI Generative AI, which uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to generate a natural-language explanation, formatted for both internal review and external (regulatory or provider) communication. 

5. In the **Select Final Prior Authorization Option** section, the available options are displayed. If more data is needed, the reviewer can upload documents, add missing codes, and trigger a re-evaluation. The system dynamically updates the risk graph, adjusts the recommendation, and generates a decision letter sent directly to the provider

    ![Amelie Shepherd Recommendation](./images/amelie-shepherd-recommendation.png =50%x*)

6. Select the AI-recommended authorization decision. In this example, that is **Approved**. 

    >Please note that your results may vary. The information provided is generated by OCI Generative AI services, and your outcomes may differ from those presented.

    ![Amelie Select Option](./images/amelie-select-option.png =50%x*)

7. Set the final authorization status to **Approved**, then click **Confirm Decision** to complete the process.

    The authorization status has been updated to 'Approved' and saved to the patient profile.

    ![Amelie Shepherd Save Status](./images/amelie-save-status.png =50%x*)

8.  Click the **Download Decision as PDF** button.

    ![Amelie Shepherd Download Recommendation](./images/amelie-shepherd-download.png =50%x*)

9.  Click **Download PDF**

    ![Amelie Shepherd Download PDF](./images/amelie-download-pdf.png =50%x*)

10. Display the message the patient would see by opening the downloaded PDF.

    ![Open Amelie Shepherd PDF](./images/open-amelie-pdf.png =50%x*)

11. Click the **Return to Dashboard** button to navigate back to the Dashboard.

    ![Return to Dashboard](./images/amelie-return-dashboard.png =50%x*)

12. Expand **View Approved Patients**. We can see that Amelie Shepherd has been removed from the Pending Patients list and has been added to the Approved Patients list.

    ![Amelie Shepherd Approved List](./images/amelie-approved-list.png =50%x*)

**Task Summary**

Once you select and save one of the 3 authorization options recommended by the AI: 

✅ The patient's authorization status is updated.

✅ A finalized PDF decision document is generated.  

✅ The dashboard reflects the change in real-time — marking Amelie as Approved.

Congratulations, you have just approved your first patient authorization! Proceed to the next task.

## Task 3: Demo - Requesting more info for a patient with medium risk
In this example, you will navigate the application to review a customer and request more info them as part of the exercise. The second user on your to-do list is Izzie Stevens.

1. On the Dashboard page, from the pending review list, select the Patient ID for **Izzie Stevens**.

    ![Select Izzie Stevens](./images/izzie-stevens.png =50%x*)

2. Opening Izzie Stevens’s profile displays her patient history details. Within a few seconds, the AI automatically generates recommendations. In this case, the system evaluates a profile with medium and identifies key risk factors.

    This customer has: 

    * **Diagnosis of Hypertension**
    * A **vague physician's note**
    * And is requesting  **pre-authorization for treatment**

    The AI evaluates the profile and suggests next steps. In this case, it recommends a requesting more info and also provides clear, actionable guidance to help the patient improve their chances of approval in the future.

    ![Izzie Stevens AI generated recommendations](./images/izzie-stevens-ai.png =50%x*)

3. Select the **Navigate to Decisions** button.

    ![Izzie-Stevens Decision](./images/izzie-stevens-decision.png =50%x*)

>⁉️ **What are two reasons that the AI needs more information from this applicant?** ⁉️

5. The authorization status is set to **Request Info**. Click the **Confirm Decision** button.

    The authorization status has been updated to 'Request Info' and saved to the patient profile.

    ![Izzie Stevens Save Status](./images/izzie-stevens-save.png =50%x*)

6. Press the **Download Decision as PDF** button to save the AI responses and proceed to the final authorization disposition.

7. Click the **Download PDF** button.

    ![Izzie Stevens Download Recommendation](./images/izzie-download.png =50%x*)

8. Display the message the patient would see by opening the downloaded PDF.

    ![Open Izzie Stevens PDF](./images/open-izzie-pdf.png =50%x*)

9. Click the **Return to Dashboard** button to navigate back to the Dashboard.

    ![Return to Dashboard](./images/izzie-return-dashboard.png =50%x*)

10. Expand **View In Progress Patients**. You will see that Izzie Stevens has been moved from the **Pending Patients** list to the **In Progress** list.

    ![Izzie Steven In Progress List](./images/izzie-inprogress-list.png =50%x*)

**Task Summary**

Congratulations, you have finished reviewing a patient with medium authorization risk! Proceed to the next task.

## Task 4: Demo - Update patient details

Lastly, let’s explore how the system uses JSON Duality Views to handle profile updates. In this task, you will edit a patient's details. In this example, the patient was asked to submit updated lab results.

1. On the Dashboard page, from the **Pending Patients** list, select the patient ID for **Andrew Deluca**.

    ![Select Andrew Deluca](./images/andrew-deluca.png =50%x*)

2. We will upload a document to update Andrew's physician's note. On the Patient Details page, click the **Upload Document** button. The PDF file has been loaded. Then click the **Process Selected PDF** button

    ![Upload Document](./images/upload-document.png =50%x*)

>💡 **JSON Duality Views** in 23ai let's you update unstructured data in an easy, high-level format while automatically handling the technical details behind the scenes. This makes it faster and simpler to work with messy data and connect it to structured systems.

4. The patient profile has been updated.

    ![Customer Profile Updated](./images/profile-updated.png)

**Task Summary**

Once the document is uploaded:

✅ The system automatically detects the new lab data.

✅ Then their profile will be updated with a physician's note.

✅ And thanks to JSON Transform and JSON Duality Views, only the relevant field is modified — leaving the rest of the profile UNTOUCHED.

## Conclusion

In conclusion our Prior Authorizations Management App was able to leverage Oracle database 23ai technologies such as **AI Vector Search, Property Graph and JSON Duality Views** to:

✅ Automate profile evaluations

✅ Provide AI-driven authorization recommendations by using an RAG model powered by a Oracle Database 23ai's AI Vector Search and OCI Generative AI service
