# Introduction

## About this Workshop

**Data is more than an asset—it’s the engine behind every smart decision, risk calculation and growth strategy. From real-time decision-making to risk management and innovation, success hinges on how well you harness it.**

Generative AI and Oracle Database 23ai makes it possible to unlock deeper insights, faster—directly within your database.

In this hands-on workshop, you’ll build a finance-focused GenAI solution using Oracle Database 23ai. 

You will:
  *	Use **native Vector Search** to query and analyze structured data, documents, and images—without moving data across platforms.

  *	Combine your **enterprise data with large language models (LLMs)** using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer natural language questions with context-aware accuracy.

  * Automate real-world financial workflows, like loan approvals, by **embedding and querying unstructured data** in real time.

By the end of this workshop, you’ll understand how Oracle Database 23ai helps financial organizations:

  * ✅ Accelerate time-to-insight with centralized, AI-ready data

  * ✅ Build intelligent apps without specialized AI infrastructure

  * ✅ Drive data-driven decisions with consistent, governed access


**Start building where your data already lives—with Oracle Database 23ai.** 

**Your next breakthrough is just a lab away!**


To get things started we invite you to watch the introduction video to see the demo in action:

#### ➡️ **Start coding!**

Lab 1 describes how to get access to our browser-based development environment. Make sure to check it out before continuing to Lab 2 and 3, where you will get hands-on and start interacting with Python with Oracle Database 23ai:

  * ✅ Connect to the database using Python

  * ✅ Run SQL queries with Python

  * ✅ Create JSON Duality Views

  * ✅ Connect to the database using a Mongo API driver

  * ✅ Use the Mongo API to query and update data

  * ✅ Implement AI Vector Search

In lab 3, you will learn how to **implement a working example of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using Oracle Database 23ai.**

#### ➡️ **Start experimenting!**

You can also experiment with the code in your own environment. The workshop environment is flexible and allows you try out different things: Start building your own version of the loan approval application!

### Objectives

* Learn how Oracle Database 23ai capabilities can be used to automate and enhance the loan approval process

* Start coding with Python and Oracle's Python driver `oracledb`

* Learn how to implement and interact with Oracle Database 23ai's new features using Python

* Implement a working example of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using Oracle Database 23ai

* Try a coding challenge and implement a solution using AI Vector Search

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle account to submit your a LiveLabs Sandbox reservation.

* Basic knowledge of Python.

* Basic knowledge of Oracle Database, i.e., how to run queries.
