# Introduction

## About this Workshop

**Data is more than an asset—it’s the engine behind every smart decision, risk calculation and growth strategy. From real-time decision-making to risk management and innovation, success hinges on how well you harness it.**

Generative AI and Oracle Database 23ai makes it possible to unlock deeper insights, faster—directly within your database.

This hands-on lab introduces you to Generative AI and Vector Search in Oracle Database 23ai, allowing you to build real applications using multiple types of data - no setup required. You'll connect to the database using Python and the Mongo API, run queries, create JSON Duality Views, and implement AI Vector Search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Explore guided healthcare use cases or experiment freely in a browser-based development environment designed to bring Oracle 23ai’s capabilities to life in a healthcare context.

To get things started we invite you to watch the introduction video to see the demo in action:

You will:
  *	Use **native Vector Search** to query and analyze structured data, documents, and images—without moving data across platforms.

  *	Combine your **enterprise data with large language models (LLMs)** using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer natural language questions with context-aware accuracy.

  * Automate real-world financial workflows, like loan approvals, by **embedding and querying unstructured data** in real time.

By the end of this workshop, you’ll understand how Oracle Database 23ai helps financial organizations:

  * ✅ Accelerate time-to-insight with centralized, AI-ready data

  * ✅ Build intelligent apps without specialized AI infrastructure

  * ✅ Drive data-driven decisions with consistent, governed access


**Start building where your data already lives—with Oracle Database 23ai.** 

**Your next breakthrough is just a lab away!**


#### ➡️ **Start with the demo! (Lab 1)**

Check out the demo to see how Generative AI and Vector Search in the database, can operate against multiple types of data—empowering you to build real applications and make faster, smarter decisions. The best part? **No setup required**—just start with Lab 1 and follow the guide. You can explore guided use cases or experiment on your own using the demo application:

  * ✅ Login as a Healthcare Claims Analyst

  * ✅ Review patients that have been recommended by the system to be approved or denied for a claim

  * ✅ Upload information to a patient's profile

#### ➡️ **Start coding! (Labs 2-4)**

Lab 2 describes how to get access to our browser-based development environment. Make sure to check it out before continuing to Lab 3 and 4, where you will get hands-on and start interacting with Python with Oracle Database 23ai:

  * ✅ Connect to the database using Python

  * ✅ Run SQL queries with Python

  * ✅ Create JSON Duality Views

  * ✅ Connect to the database using a Mongo API driver

  * ✅ Use the Mongo API to query and update data

  * ✅ Implement AI Vector Search

  * ✅ Implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using Oracle Database 23ai

#### ➡️ **Start experimenting! (Lab 5)**

You can also experiment with the code in your own environment. The workshop environment is flexible and allows you try out different things: Start building your own version of the prior authorization application!

  * ✅ Vectorize patient data from one table into another

  * ✅ Verify the data was vectorized

  * ✅ Implement a similarity search

### Objectives

* Learn how Oracle Database 23ai capabilities can be used to automate and enhance the prior authorization process, justifying medical-necessity decisions

* Start coding with Python and Oracle's Python driver `oracledb`

* Learn how to implement and interact with Oracle Database 23ai's new features using Python

* Implement a working example of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using Oracle Database 23ai

* Try a coding challenge and implement a solution using AI Vector Search

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle account to submit your a LiveLabs Sandbox reservation.

* Basic knowledge of Python.

* Basic knowledge of Oracle Database, i.e., how to run queries.
