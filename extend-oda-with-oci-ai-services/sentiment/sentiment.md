## Introduction

In this lab, you'll extend the skill to leverage the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure AI detect sentiment service. 

## Task 1: Respond to User Feedback



1.  Click Flows in the left navbar.
	
2.  Click **+ Add Flow** button to add a new intent-driven flow to the skill using the following properties.
    *   **Name** - `collect.feedback`
    *   **Description** - `Flow to collect customer feedback on Pizza & service`
    *   **Intent Name** - `pizza.reg.giveFeedback`

![](images/sentiment1.png =20%x*  "")

Check **open created flow afterwards** and click **Create**.
			

3.  Press **Add start state** and add an **Ask Question** component as the Start State for the flow.
    *   **Name** - `PromptForFeedback`
    *   **Description** - `Prompt for customer feedback`
	

![](images/sentiment2.jpg =60%x*  "")

4.  Enter the Question text using the predefined resource bundle.

    `${rb('PromptForFeedback.message')}`

5.  Creating the variable that stores the user feedback by first clicking <strong>Create</strong> and then by selecting <strong>Flow Scope Variable</strong>. Define the variable properties as follows: 
    *   **Name** - `feedbackText`
    *   **Description** - `Variable to hold user feedback`
    *   **Variable Type** - `String`

![](images/sentiment3.jpg =60%x*  "")
		
Click **Apply** to create the “feedbackText” variable.

6. Call Language Service via REST Connector. Add another state by pressing **Add state**

   Select **Service Integration > Call REST Service**    
    *   **Name** - `CallSentimentService`
    *   **Description** - `Calling OCI Language API`

     **Note:** You can use the Search filter to quickly find the REST component.

 - Click **Insert** to add the component to the flow

![](images/sentiment4.jpg =60%x*  "")

				
7. In the **CallSentimentService** component palette select the **DetectSentiment** REST service from the dropdown list.

![](images/sentiment4.png =20%x*  "")


8. Select the POST method from the Methods dropdown list.

9. As we want to pass the feedback entered in the previous step, update the Request Body property.

   - Set the Request Body – **Expression** switch to **ON**
			
   - Paste the following into the Request Body Field

     ```
     { "documents": [{  "key": "pizzaFB",  "text": "${feedbackText.value}" }] }
     ```
			
   - Click outside the field to accept the input.
			
10. Confirm that the **Response Mode** is set to **Use Actual REST API Response**
	
11. Click the **Create** button to create a “Flow Scope” variable in which to store the Response from the AI REST service.
    *   **Name** - `AIServicePayload`
    *   **Description** - `Variable to hold AI Service Response`
    *   **Variable Type** - 'MAP'
		
- Click **Apply** to create the variable.
			
**Note:** if the Result variable field is not visible use the scroll bar within the component palette to bring it into view.
	

12. Navigate to the **Transitions** tab at the top of the **CallSentimentService** component Palette.
	
13. Click on the ![](../images/add.png =1%x*  "") next to the “Action” to enter the appropriate Transitions based on the outcome of the REST Service call.

    **Note:**  HTTP Status codes 2xx map to “Success”, 4xx|5xx map to “failure” in the defined REST Component


14. Select **failure** from the **Action Name** dropdown list.

    ![](images/sentiment6.png =20%x*  "")


15. Select **Add State** from the **Transition To** dropdown list.

   ![](images/sentiment7.png =20%x*  "")

16. Add a **Send Message** component to the flow to indicate an invalid REST service call.
    *   **Name** - `RequestFailed`
    *   **Description** - `Unsuccessful REST Request Message`

![](images/sentiment8.png =20%x*  "")

Click **Insert** button to add component to the flow.
	

17. Select the **RequestFailed** state in the flow to launch the component’s property Palette and navigate to the component Tab.
	

18. Enter the following Resource Bundle reference for the output message if the REST service fails.

    ```
    ${rb('requestFailed.message')}
    ```

	
19. Select the **CallSentimentService** state in the Flow to expose its component palette. Navigate to the **Transitions** tab.
	
20. Click on the ![](../images/add.png =1%x*  "") again (next to Action) to enter another Transition based on the outcome of the REST Service call.
	
21. Select **success** from the **Action Name** dropdown list.
	
22. Select **Add State** from the **Transition To** dropdown list.  This time add the **Flow Control > Invole Flow** template.
    *   **Name** - `RespondToFeedback`
    *   **Description** - `Calling a predefined flow to respond to the sentiment within the user’s feedback`


![](images/sentiment9.png =20%x*  "")

23. Select the **RespondToFeedback** state in the flow and navigate to the component tab
	
24. Select the **respond.to.feedback** flow from the choice of available flows in the dropdown list.
	
25. Click on the ![](../images/add.png =1%x*  "") next to the **Input Parameters** to specify the data to be passed to the **respond.to.feedback** flow.  In this case we want to pass in the ‘sentiment’ extracted from the feedback previously entered.
	
26. Choose the **sentiment** parameter from the dropdown list.
	
27. Paste the following ${freemarker expression} to retrieve the Sentiment from the Payload that was returned in the previous **CallSentimentService** state.  Remember the payload was stored in the **AIServicePayload** variable.

	```
    ${AIServicePayload.value.responsePayload.documents[0].documentSentiment}
    ```
![](images/sentiment10.png =20%x*  "")

	- Click the ![](../images/save.png) (tick) to save the parameter definition.
			
This completes the development of the feedback flow that captures the sentiment from the user’s feedback.

## Task 2: Test The Flow
1. Test the flow by testing the intent in the conversation preview.
	

2. Enter _**I want to give some feedback**_ to kick off the intent
	

3. Enter some feedback that reflects a Positive or Negative response to the Pizza order.
   Eg.
	- The delivery was very slow, and the pizza was cold
	- The pizza was piping hot and tasted great.
	- I have had better pizzas
	- Awesome pizza!!
	- I will order this again
	- Worst pizza ever!
