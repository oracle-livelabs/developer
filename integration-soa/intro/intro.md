# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This Oracle SOA workshop demonstrates an implementation of business use case for integration by walking through application development - validating payment for an online ordering system. The ordering system will also need to be integrated and invoked by a mobile application via *https/REST*. The following are covered under this workshop:

- Introducing SOA development tool, JDeveloper 12c
- Design Integration composite using JDeveloper as an IDE
- Develop and build the SOA service orchestration on JDeveloper 12c
- Register the composite with Service Bus and deploy
- REST-api enabled the composite on SOA server in JDeveloper

This workshop consists of 4 separate labs and are recommended to be performed in the order provided.  

| # | Lab | Estimate Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Integration using Oracle SOA | 10 min |
| 2 | Build composite integration app for validating payment | 90 min |
| 3 | Register the composite app to Service Bus | 60 min |
| 4 | Enabled REST api access for Validate Payment app | 60 min |

<!-- In the advanced workshop, the order processing would also integrate with systems and apps from the packaging department to do ship orders with preferred shipping providers based on the type of shipping service (2 day, 5-7 day shipping, and so on).

The bulk fulfillment process must run according to a predefined pick-up schedule. Upon fulfillment processing and orders being sent to the packaging department, a message must be communicated to the customer (either bulk or on-demand). -->

*Estimated Lab Time*: 220 minutes
