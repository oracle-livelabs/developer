# Environment Setup

## Introduction

This tutorial is an introduction to using Python with Oracle Database. It contains beginner and advanced material. Follow the steps in this document. The **tutorial** directory has scripts to run and modify.
When you run this lab in Oracle's sandbox, upon login, the creation of an Oracle Autonomous Database, including the 'pythondemo' schema used throughout the tutorial has been created for you. Tables have been created and populated with data.
During this lab, the following steps have been automated:
* the installation of the **python-oracledb** driver
* the setup and configuration of a connection to the Oracle Autonomous Database Serverless

During this lab, you will run the Shell script to setup the environment and you will test the connection to Oracle Autonomous Database from Python.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

TODO: Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

### About python-oracledb driver

**python-oracledb** driver is a Python extension module that enables access to Oracle Database. This latest, renamed release of the widely used cx_Oracle driver introduces a new ‘Thin’ mode for direct connection to the database and it conforms to the Python database API 2.0 specification with a considerable number of additions and a couple of exclusions.

python-oracledb driver is compatible with Python versions 3.6 through 3.11. Prebuilt packages are available on Windows for Python 3.7 or later, on macOS for Python 3.7 or later, and on Linux for Python 3.6 or later.

python-oracledb 1.3.2 is available. It has a default **Thin** mode for direct connection to Oracle Database and Oracle client libraries are optional.
In **Thick** mode, some advanced Oracle Database functionality is currently only available when optional Oracle Client libraries are loaded by python-oracledb. Libraries are available in the free Oracle Instant Client packages. Python-oracledb can use Oracle Client libraries 11.2 through 21c.

Python is open-source, cross-platform, and free of cost. There's no excuse not to give Python a try!

### Objectives

In this lab, you will run a Shell script that will automatically install the python-oracledb driver

    *Note: This Livelab is using Cloud Shell, which has Python 3.8.14 preinstalled.*

* Connect to the Oracle Autonomous Database Serverless using the python-oracledb driver
* Learn how to validate Python operations

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have completed the following steps:
* Login to the Oracle Sandbox
* Have an Oracle Autonomous Database Serverless already created
* have Python 3 installed. NOTE: In your own instance, Python 3 can be obtained from your operating system package library or from [python.org](https://python.org). On Windows, use Python 3.7 or later. On macOS, use Python 3.8 or later. On Linux, use Python 3.6 or later.

## Task 1: Download Oracle Autonomous Database Wallet

1.  Login to Oracle Cloud Account (Launch OCI in the Reservation Information Page)
2.  Click the **Navigation** Menu in the upper left, navigate to **Oracle Database** and select **Autonomous Database**

    NOTE: Make sure that on the left hand pane, you select the compartment corresponding to your reservation allocation (i.e.: LL47448-COMPARTMENT)

    ![Compartment](./images/compartment_selection.png " ")

3.  Select the Autonomous Database listed
4.  In the Autonomous Database Summary screen, select **Database Connection** tab and in the popup **Database Connection** window, in the **Download Client Credentials (Wallet)** section,
    -  select Wallet Type: Instance Wallet
    - hit **Download Wallet** button
![Wallet](./images/wallet.png " ")

5. Specify password for the Wallet (please use the password provided by your Tutor)

    Hit **Download** button and save the wallet as a zip file to a location on your local laptop, then click Close to close the popup window. We will upload this file on Console Shell in the next task, so please make a note of the location where the .zip wallet is saved.

    ![Wallet password](./images/wallet_password.png " ")

6. Click __Close__.

## Task 2: Upload Wallet to the Cloud Shell

**Cloud Shell**  is a web browser-based terminal accessible from the Oracle Cloud Console and available to all Oracle Cloud Infrastructure users. It’s free to use (within monthly tenancy limits), and it provides access to a Linux shell with a pre-authenticated CLI and other useful tools for following Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service tutorials and labs. The Cloud Shell appears in the Console as a persistent frame and stays active as you navigate to different parts of the Console. Cloud Shell is pre-authenticated with your console credentials.

In the Oracle Autonomous Database Summary screen, we're going to launch Cloud Shell (this has Python pre-installed), and in the subsequent labs we're going to connect to the Autonomous Database Serverless using the Wallet downloaded at the previous task.  

1. To launch the Cloud Shell, sign in to the Sandbox Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy and click the command prompt icon in Console header, then select Cloud Shell from the drop down:

 ![Cloud Shell](./images/cloud_shell.png " ")
2. When prompted to run tutorial, type N and enter.

 ![Cloud Shell](./images/run_tutorial.png " ")

3. When connected, the following should display:
 ![Cloud Shell terminal](./images/cloud_shell_term.png " ")

4. Drag and drop the Wallet archive from the location where it was saved, to the Console Shell
 ![Cloud shell wallet](./images/cloud_shell_wallet.png " ")


## Task 3: Download the Environment Setup Automation Shell Script

1. Get the Shell script from [here](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/0lxAU69Cob5L8l_8D3fUQ6V7TWeO6HBhUkrNe_6W0xeDUveXEbfdq4sJZGrpHf8o/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/developer-library/tutorial_script.sh):

    In the Cloud Shell, run the following:

    ````
    <copy>
    cd
    wget https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/0lxAU69Cob5L8l_8D3fUQ6V7TWeO6HBhUkrNe_6W0xeDUveXEbfdq4sJZGrpHf8o/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/developer-library/tutorial_script.sh
    </copy>
    ````

2. Run the Shell script:
    ````
    <copy>
    . ./tutorial_script.sh
    </copy>
    ````

    The script will run all the enviroment configuration for you, including:
    * python-oracledb driver install
    * download the sample files on Cloud Shell
    * environment setup to allow connection to the Oracle Autonomous Database Serverless.

    The **samples/tutorial** directory has scripts to run and modify. The **samples/tutorial/sql** directory has all the SQL scripts used by the Python files to create database tables and other objects.

    **NOTE**: if by any reason you need to logon back to the Sandbox OCI environment, you need to rerun the script in order to set the environment variables again

### Additional notes, for your own reference (you do not need to take any action during this lab):


### Install Python 3

Python comes preinstalled on most Linux distributions, and for this LiveLab, the Cloud Shell already has Python 3.8.14 preinstalled, so you don't have to run this step. In case you wanted to install Python in your own environment, outside of Oracle Sandbox, the steps for installing it are provided below.
The Python packages can be obtained from the software repository of your Linux distribution using the package manager.

1. Open up the Oracle Cloud Shell and check if python3 has been installed, by running the command:

    ````
    <copy>
    python3 -V
    </copy>
    ````

    For this tutorial, Python version 3.6 (or later) is preferred. python-oracledb version 1.0 (or later) is needed.

    You must have an Oracle Autonomous Database already created, in order to connect to it using the python-oracledb driver.

2. Upgrade Python if you do not have Python 3 installed. There is no harm in running this command multiple times, the system will either install packages or let you know they are already installed.

    ````
    <copy>
    sudo yum -y install python3 python3-tools
    </copy>
    ````

    ![install python](./images/p_installPython.jpg " ")

### Install python-oracledb driver

1.  Check if the Python driver is already installed. If you get a warning that the module is not found, then proceed to install the `python-oracledb` module using python3 and pip.

    On Oracle Linux 8, run the following in the Cloud Shell:

    ````
    <copy>
    pip show oracledb
    python3 -m pip install oracledb cryptography --user
    </copy>
    ````

    ![install driver](./images/install-driver.png " ")

    *Note* At runtime, the module name of the python-oracledb package is **oracledb**

2.  Test your install by launching the python console and list the available modules.

    ````
    <copy>
    python3
    help('modules')
    </copy>
    ````

    This command will show you a list of installed modules that should include the oracledb module we installed in the previous step.

    ![oracledb modules](./images/oracledb.png " ")

    Type exit() to return to the command line prompt

## Task 4: Environment setup

We are going to use the [Code Editor](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/code_editor_intro.htm) functionality available on your tenancy in order to edit the Python scripts, as needed.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Code Editor provides a rich, in-console editing environment that enables you to edit code and update service workflows and scripts without having to switch between the Console and your local development environment.

1. To access Code Editor, once logged in to the Sandbox Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, press the command prompt icon in Console header, then select Code Editor as in the image below:

    ![Code Editor](./images/code-editor.png " ")

    During this lab you will be reviewing and editing the sample tutorial files provided, so you need to open them in Code Editor:

    - From the Menu, select File > Open...

    ![Code Editor Open](./images/code-editor-open.png " ")

    - Select the location of the samples/tutorial directory and click **Open**

    ![Code Editor Open Dir](./images/code-editor-open-dir.png " ")

    - On the left side Pane > Files you should see all the files and subdirectories in the /tutorial directory. To review or modify a file, select the desired file and this opens in the file editor.

    ![Code Editor Files](./images/code-editor-files.png " ")
    - Set Autosave option under File > Autosave menu, to avoid loosing changes you make to the files.

    To access the local development environment from Code Editor, you may launch Terminal.

    ![Launch Terminal](./images/terminal.png " ")
    Alternatively, you may want to keep Cloud Shell open side by side.

    All the necessary configurations to connect to the Oracle Autonomous Database have been automated for you.

    The connection to Oracle Autonomous Database is using a few arguments:
    * **user**:         for this exercise we'll be using the **pythondemo** user
    * **password**:     password for the **pythondemo** user (the schema has already been created in the Oracle Autonomous Database)
    * **dsn**:          data source name for the Oracle Autonomous Database Serverless
    * **config dir**:   the location where the dsn connection string resides
    * **wallet location**: the location where the wallet was saved
    * **wallet password**: the password setup for the wallet

    The default values to match the system connection information for your environment, are used by the config files *db\_config.py* and *db\_config\_sys.py* in the samples/tutorial directory.

    The arguments are setup as environment variables and passed to the config files.


2. In Code Editor, review *db\_config.py* (thin mode), in the samples/tutorial directory.
This file is used by other Python files for setting up the database connection.

    ````
    import oracledb
    import os
    import getpass

    # Tutorial credentials and connection string.
    # Environment variable values are used, if they are defined.

    user = os.environ.get("PYTHON_USER", "pythondemo")      #pythondemo schema, or your preferred schema when connecting to ADB
    pw = os.environ.get("PYTHON_PASSWORD")
    if pw is None:
        pw = getpass.getpass("Enter password for %s: " % user)
    config_dir = os.environ.get("CONFIG_DIR")
    dsn = os.environ.get("DSN_ADB")
    wallet_location = os.environ.get("WALLET_LOCATION")
    wallet_password = os.environ.get("WALLET_PASSWORD")
    if wallet_password is None:
        wallet_password = getpass.getpass("Enter password for the Wallet: " )
    ````

    At runtime, the module name of the python-oracledb package is **oracledb**

## Task 5: Test Connection to Oracle Autonomous Database
By default, python-oracledb runs in a _Thin_ mode which connects directly to Oracle Database.

There are two ways to create a connection to Oracle Autonomous Database using python-oracledb driver:
- **Standalone connections**: [standalone connections](https://python-oracledb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/connection_handling.html#standaloneconnection) are useful when the application needs a single connection to the database. Connections are created by calling **oracledb.connect()**
- **Pooled connections**: [connection pooling](https://python-oracledb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/connection_handling.html#connpooling) is important for performance when applications frequently connect and disconnect from the database. Pools support Oracle's [high-availability](https://python-oracledb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/ha.html#highavailability) features and are recommended for applications that must be reliable. Small pools can also be useful for applications that want a few connections available for infrequent use. Pools are created with **oracledb.create_pool()** at application initialization time, and then **ConnectionPool.acquire()** can be called to obtain a connection from the pool.

Connect to the Oracle Database and print the version of the database via Python. This confirms you are connected to an Oracle instance and returns the database version.

1. In Code Editor, review the code contained in *connect.py*:

    ````
    <copy>
    import oracledb
    import db_config

    con = oracledb.connect(
                        user=db_config.user,
                        password=db_config.pw,
                        dsn=db_config.dsn,
                        config_dir=db_config.config_dir,
                        wallet_location=db_config.wallet_location,
                        wallet_password=db_config.wallet_password)

    print("Database version:", con.version)
    </copy>
    ````

    The username, the password, the connection string and the wallet information that you configured in the db\_config.py module is passed to the connect() method. By default, Oracle's Easy Connect connection string syntax is used.

2. Create a basic connection

    In a Terminal window or in Cloud Shell, run the script as below:

    ````
    <copy>
    python3 connect.py
    </copy>
    ````

    The version number of the database should be displayed. An exception is raised if the connection fails.

    ![Connect](./images/connect.png " ")

3.  Executing a query.

    Open **query.py** in Code Editor. It looks like:

    ````
    <copy>
    import oracledb
    import db_config

    con = oracledb.connect(user=db_config.user,
                        password=db_config.pw,
                        dsn=db_config.dsn,
                        config_dir=db_config.config_dir,
                        wallet_location=db_config.wallet_location,
                        wallet_password=db_config.wallet_password)

    cur = con.cursor()
    cur.execute("select * from dept order by deptno")
    res = cur.fetchall()
    for row in res:
        print(row)
    </copy>
    ````

    Make sure the print(row) line is indented. This lab uses spaces, not tabs.

    The code executes a query and fetches all data.

    Save the file and run it:

    ````
    <copy>
    python3 query.py
    </copy>
    ````

    ![Query execution](./images/query.png " " )

    In each loop iteration a new row is stored in row as a Python "tuple" and is displayed.

    Fetching Data is described in a later section

4.  Closing connections

    Connections and other resources used by python-oracledb will automatically be closed at the end of scope. This is a common programming style that takes care of the correct order of resource closure.

    Resources can also be explicitly closed to free up database resources if they are no longer needed. This may be useful in blocks of code that remain active for some time.

    Open *query.py* in Code Editor and add calls to close the cursor and connection like:

    ````
    <copy>
    import oracledb
    import db_config

    con = oracledb.connect(user=db_config.user,
                        password=db_config.pw,
                        dsn=db_config.dsn,
                        config_dir=db_config.config_dir,
                        wallet_location=db_config.wallet_location,
                        wallet_password=db_config.wallet_password)

    cur = con.cursor()
    cur.execute("select * from dept order by deptno")
    res = cur.fetchall()
    for row in res:
        print(row)

    cur.close()
    con.close()
    </copy>
    ````

    Running the script completes without error:

    ````
    <copy>
    python3 query.py
    </copy>
    ````

    ![Query with cursor closed](./images/query.png " " )

    If you swap the order of the two close() calls you will see an error.

5.  Checking versions

    Review the code contained in *versions.py*:

    ````
    <copy>
    import oracledb
    import db_config

    con = oracledb.connect(user=db_config.user,
                        password=db_config.pw,
                        dsn=db_config.dsn,
                        config_dir=db_config.config_dir,
                        wallet_location=db_config.wallet_location,
                        wallet_password=db_config.wallet_password)

    print(oracledb.__version__)  # two underscores before and after the version
    print("Database version:", con.version)
    </copy>
    ````

    Run the script in Cloud Shell or a terminal window:

    ````
    <copy>
    python3 versions.py
    </copy>
    ````

    This gives the version of the oracledb interface.

    ![Versions results](./images/versions.png " " )
