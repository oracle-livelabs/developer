## Task 1: Create a Skill

In this lab, we're starting from scratch. So the first thing you'll do is create a new skill.

1.  With the Oracle Digital Assistant UI open in your browser, click ![](images/hamburger.png "") to open the side menu.
2.  Click **Development** and then select **Skills**.

The Create Skill dialog appears.

8.  For **Display Name** enter `Pizza King`. If you are working in an environment where others may also be creating the same tutorial, prefix `Pizza King` with your unique initials.
9.  Optionally, fill in a one-sentence description (e.g., `Skill for ordering from Pizza King`)
10.  For the other fields, leave the default values. Note that the Dialog Mode is **Visual**. Later on in this tutorial, you're going to create a dialog flow, the definition of the skill-user conversation, using the declarative approach of the Visual Flow Designer.

11.  Click **Create**.
    
    The designer will then open on the Intents ![](../images/left_nav_intents.png  "") page. Here's where we'll begin to express the Pizza King customer use case in terms of the concepts that support Natural Language Processing (NLP).
