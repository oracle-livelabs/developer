# Introduction


This 60-minute hands-on lab is an entry-level exercise for building a skill in Oracle Digital Assistant.

### Background

Oracle Digital Assistant is an environment for building _digital assistants_, which are user interfaces driven by artificial intelligence (AI) that help users accomplish a variety of tasks in natural language conversations. Digital assistants consist of one or more _skills_, which are individual chatbots that are focused on specific types of tasks.

In this lab, you will create a skill that can be used for interactions with a pizzeria, including ordering pizzas and canceling orders. As part of this process, you will:

*   Define intents, utterances, entities.
*   Design a conversation flow.
*   Validate, debug and test your skill.

### What Do You Need?
