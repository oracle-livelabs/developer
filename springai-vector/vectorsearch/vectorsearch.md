### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Look at Spring AI RAG application's front-end (GUI), and understand it.
- Look at the code implementation of our GenAI RAG application with Spring AI, Cohere AI, Oracle AI Vector Search and the Oracle Database 23ai, and understand it.
- Configure the Spring AI application to use the Cohere Command-R model

### Prerequisites

1. This lab requires the completion of **Setup Dev Environment**.

## Task 1: Understand the Spring AI RAG application's front-end (GUI)

The main screen has one (1) input field and one (1) button. The input field is used to specify your GenAI RAG prompt, and the button will start the interaction with the Cohere CommandR GenAI model. 

1. Just type your prompt, or use the default one, then the Ask Now! button to start the interaction.

2. The Spring AI application will initiates the interaction and submits a prompt to the RAG process that will be executed with data combined from the remote Cohere AI Command-R model and the Oracle Database 23ai, which will use the Oracle AI Vector Search functionality to retrieve the embeddings (store vector data).

3. As soon as the RAG process completes, a response will be returned and presented to the user with the relevant results, as shown below.

    ![telegram-bot-gui-new-item-button](images/rag-results.png "telegram new item button")


## Task 2: Understand the Spring AI with Cohere AI and Oracle Database 23ai implementation

The application is simple; it uses Spring Boot and the Spring AI frameworks to perform the interactions with both the Cohere AI Command-R model and the Oracle Database 23ai, which is accessed with JDBC, UCP and Oracle AI Vector Search to retrieve the vector embeddings that support the RAG functionality.

1. The central component that controls the ingestion of our domain-related data, that is a PDF file -  What’s in Oracle Database 23ai for Java Developers? - which is started along with the Spring Boot/AI application on the same main entry point class, that is, the Java class with the "@SpringBootApplication" annotation. Specifically, the Java class OracleDatabaseVectorStoreConfig.java with the "@Configuration" annotation will perform the ingestion steps.

![db-store-config](images/spring-db-vector-store-config.png "spring ai db store configuration")

2. The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is started as part of the application's bootstrap process, and the PDF contents will be ingested and stored as vector embeddings as expected.

    ![vector-embeddings](images/vector-embeddings.png "oracle database vector embeddings ")

3. The Spring RAG controller class - OracleDatabaseController.java - implements the Spring AI RAG functionality will expose a REST endpoint (/ragpage) that will redirect the users to the landing page of our application.

    ![spring-rag-controller](images/spring-rag-controller.png "spring boot rag controller ")

4. Next, the Spring service class - OracleDatabaseVectorService.java - implements the RAG interaction implementation, and comprises methods to start the similarity search and the template for the input prompt.

    ![spring-rag-service](images/rag-prompt-template-similarity.png "spring boot service")

5. Now the most important Java implementation class - OracleDatabaseVectorStore.java - as it has the custom implementation of Spring AI's VectorStore interface to deliver the actual vector store implementation that uses the Oracle AI Vector Search functionality provided by the Oracle Database 23ai. It provides the core functionality that supports our vector/similarity search against the Oracle Database.  

    ![spring-ai-vector-store](images/spring-ai-vector-store-implementation.png "spring ai vector store implementation for the oracle database")

6. Last, there are three (3) utility classes that support the custom vector store implementation, the RAG ingestion steps, and the vector search functionality. The most important ones are OracleDistanceType.java and PdfDataExtractor.java. The former specifies the Oracle distance types that support the search.

    ![vector-search-distance-types](images/oracle-distance-types.png "oracle vector search distance types")

The latter implements an interface provided by Spring AI that supports the ingestion of PDF files that is, the org.springframework.ai.reader.pdf.PagePdfDocumentReader interface.

## Task 3: Configure the Spring AI application

You must configure your Spring AI application to use the Cohere Command-R model. You must provide the model URL, the chat model name, and the embeddings model name. After that, you have to configure the JDBC connection details.

1. Configure the Cohere AI model details. Navigate to `$MTDRWORKSHOP_LOCATION/backend/src/main/resources`, use a text editor (vi, vim, nano, etc) to open the application.properties file, then add the three entries below to configure the "Cohere Command-R model" parameters.

    ```
    <copy>
    cd $MTDRWORKSHOP_LOCATION/backend/src/main/resources
    vi application.properties
    </copy>
    ```

    ![spring-ai-properties-cohere](images/spring-ai-cohere-model-config.png "spring ai configuration for cohere ai command-r model")

2. Note that you have to provide the hostname of your server where the model is located.

    ```
    <copy>    
    # COHERE command-r
    #https://txt.cohere.com/command-r/
    spring.ai.ollama.base-url=http://<COHERE_MODEL_SERVER_IP>:11434
    spring.ai.ollama.embedding.options.model=command-r
    spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.model=command-r
    ```

3. Configure the JDBC connection details as below. Navigate to Oracle Database -> Autonomous Transaction Processing, then select your Oracle Autonomous Database 23ai instance. Click the Database connection button.

    ![jdbc-conn-info](images/jdbc-conn-info.png "jdbc connection details")

4. Scroll down to the Connection strings, then copy a TNS name.

    ![jdbc-conn-string-tns](images/jdbc-conn-string-tns.png "connection string tns name")

5. Go to your application.properties file, and adjust the entries below accordingly.

    ![jdbc-connection](images/jdbc-connection.png "jdbc connection details application dot properties")

    ```
    <copy>    
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@<TODO_PDB_NAME>_tp?TNS_ADMIN=/mtdrworkshop/creds
    spring.datasource.username=VECTOR_USER
    spring.datasource.password=<VECTOR_USER_PASSWORD>
    ```
6. Save the application.properties file as usual.

## Task 4: Create the VECTOR database table

You must conect to your database instance and create a database table with a VECTOR data type colum.

1. Open the Oracle Cloud Console, navigate to your Oracle Database 23ai instance, then click on it.

    ![db23ai-instance](images/db23ai-instance.png "navigate to oracle database 23ai instance")

2. Next, select the Database actions drop-down box, and select SQL.

    ![db23ai-dbaction-sql](images/db23ai-dbaction-sql.png "db 23 ai sql action")

3. The Oracle Database Actions | SQL console will open. Copy the script content below.

    ```
    CREATE USER VECTOR_USER IDENTIFIED BY <YOUR_DB_PASSWORD> QUOTA UNLIMITED ON USERS;  
    GRANT DB_DEVELOPER_ROLE TO VECTOR_USER;  
    GRANT CREATE SESSION TO VECTOR_USER;  
    GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE ON SCHEMA VECTOR_USER TO VECTOR_USER;  
    CREATE TABLE VECTOR_USER.VECTOR_STORE (ID VARCHAR2(64) PRIMARY KEY, METADATA VARCHAR(256), CONTENT CLOB, VECTOR_DATA VECTOR(8192, FLOAT64));
    CREATE VECTOR INDEX VECTOR_STORE_INDEX ON VECTOR_USER.VECTOR_STORE (VECTOR_DATA) ORGANIZATION NEIGHBOR PARTITIONS DISTANCE COSINE WITH TARGET ACCURACY 95; 
    COMMIT;
    ```
4. Paste it into the Worksheet page as shown below, then click the Run Statement button to execute the script.

    ![db23ai-sql-ddl](images/db23ai-sql-ddl.png "db 23 ai sql ddl") 

5. Provided that everything goes well, you can run a describe command to check the table details as shown below.

   ![database-table](images/database-table.png "describe database table")

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
