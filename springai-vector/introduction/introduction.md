# Introduction

## About this Workshop



This workshop will introduce basic concepts related to GenAI to allow Java developers to use the Oracle Database, Oracle AI Vector Search, Spring AI and the Cohere Command-R model to implement some Generative AI use cases. You will learn how to implement RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to augment the context of an existing Large Language Model (LLM) to add business related context to your GenAI-related applications, while utilizing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services.

Estimated Workshop Time: 50 minutes

### Objectives

In this 3 part workshop, you will:

* Provision a Kubernetes cluster, Oracle Autonomous Database, a Container Registry, and the Cohere Command-R GenAI model
* Understand, build, and deploy a Java tier to implement REST APIs and a GenAI use case with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), the Spring Boot framework, Docker, the OCI Container Registry, and a Kubernetes service
* Understand, build, and deploy a Cohere Command-R model to receive REST API calls from a Spring AI application. The solution also has a React JS front that you can deploy over an OCI Object storage bucket.

### Prerequisites

1. Please refer to "Get Started"

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
